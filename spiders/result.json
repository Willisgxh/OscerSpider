But the sequence of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is clear. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors (gastrinomas) form in your pancreas or duodenum or at other sites such as the lymph nodes adjacent to your pancreas.\nYour pancreas sits behind and below your stomach. It produces enzymes that are essential to digesting food. The pancreas also produces several hormones including insulin, a hormone that helps to control your blood glucose.\nDigestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum, the part of the small intestine next to your stomach. This is where digestion reaches its peak.\nThe tumors that occur with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are made up of cells that secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Increased gastrin makes the stomach produce far too much acid. The excess acid then leads to peptic ulcers and sometimes to diarrhea.\nBesides causing excess acid production, the tumors are often cancerous (malignant). Although the tumors tend to grow slowly, the cancer can spread elsewhere \u2014 most commonly to nearby lymph nodes or your liver.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Association with MEN 1Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may be caused by an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1). People with MEN 1 also have tumors in the parathyroid glands and may have tumors in their pituitary glands.\nAbout 25% of people who have gastrinomas have them as part of Men 1. They may also have tumors in the pancreas and other organs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will base a diagnosis on the following:\n\n    Medical history. Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and review your medical history.\n    \n    Blood tests. A sample of your blood is analyzed to see whether you have elevated gastrin levels. While elevated gastrin may indicate tumors in your pancreas or duodenum, it can also be caused by other conditions. For example, gastrin may also be elevated if your stomach isn't making acid, or you're taking acid-reducing medications, such as proton pump inhibitors.\n    You need to fast before this test and may need to stop taking any acid-reducing medications to get the most accurate measure of your gastrin levels. Because gastrin levels can fluctuate, this test may be repeated a few times.\n    Your doctor may also perform a secretin stimulation test. For this test, your doctor first measures your gastrin levels, then gives you an injection of the hormone secretin and measures gastrin levels again. If you have Zollinger-Ellison, your gastrin levels will increase even more.\n    \n    Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. After you're sedated, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible instrument with a light and video camera (endoscope) down your throat and into your stomach and duodenum to look for ulcers. Through the endoscope, your doctor may remove a tissue sample (biopsy) from your duodenum to help detect the presence of gastrin-producing tumors. Your doctor will ask you not to eat anything after midnight the night before the test.\n    \n    Endoscopic ultrasound. In this procedure, your doctor examines your stomach, duodenum and pancreas with an endoscope fitted with an ultrasound probe. The probe allows for closer inspection, making it easier to spot tumors.\n    It's also possible to remove a tissue sample through the endoscope. You'll need to fast after midnight the night before this test, and you'll be sedated during the test.\n    \n    Imaging tests. Your doctor may use imaging techniques such as a nuclear scan called somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. This test uses radioactive tracers to help locate tumors. Other helpful imaging tests include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT scanning.\nMore InformationCT scanEndoscopic ultrasoundMRIUltrasoundShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome addresses the hormone-secreting tumors as well as the ulcers they cause.\n        \n            \n            Treatment of tumorsAn operation to remove the tumors that occur in Zollinger-Ellison requires a skilled surgeon because the tumors are often small and difficult to locate. If you have just one tumor, your doctor may be able to remove it surgically, but surgery may not be an option if you have multiple tumors or tumors that have spread to your liver. On the other hand, even if you have multiple tumors, your doctor still may recommend removing a single large tumor.\nIn some cases, doctors advise other treatments to control tumor growth, including:\n\n    Removing as much of a liver tumor as possible (debulking)\n    Attempting to destroy the tumor by cutting off the blood supply (embolization) or by using heat to destroy cancer cells (radiofrequency ablation)\n    Injecting drugs into the tumor to relieve cancer symptoms\n    Using chemotherapy to try to slow tumor growth\n    Having a liver transplant\n\n        \n            \n            Treatment of excess acidExcess acid production can almost always be controlled. Medications known as proton pump inhibitors are the first line of treatment. These are effective medications for decreasing acid production in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\nProton pump inhibitors are powerful drugs that reduce acid by blocking the action of the tiny \"pumps\" within acid-secreting cells. Commonly prescribed medications include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and esomeprazole (Nexium).\nLong-term use of prescription proton pump inhibitors, especially in people age 50 and older, has been associated with an increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist and spine, according to the Food and Drug Administration. This risk is small and should be weighed against the acid-blocking benefits of these medications.\nOctreotide (Sandostatin), a medication similar to the hormone somatostatin, may counteract the effects of gastrin and be helpful for some people.More InformationChemotherapyLiver transplantRadiofrequency ablation for cancer\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

These medications may mask your symptoms, which could delay your diagnosis.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The exact cause of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome remains unknown. But the sequence of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is clear. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors (gastrinomas) form in your pancreas or duodenum or at other sites such as the lymph nodes adjacent to your pancreas.\nYour pancreas sits behind and below your stomach. It produces enzymes that are essential to digesting food. The pancreas also produces several hormones including insulin, a hormone that helps to control your blood glucose.\nDigestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum, the part of the small intestine next to your stomach. This is where digestion reaches its peak.\nThe tumors that occur with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are made up of cells that secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Increased gastrin makes the stomach produce far too much acid. The excess acid then leads to peptic ulcers and sometimes to diarrhea.\nBesides causing excess acid production, the tumors are often cancerous (malignant). Although the tumors tend to grow slowly, the cancer can spread elsewhere \u2014 most commonly to nearby lymph nodes or your liver.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Association with MEN 1Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may be caused by an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1). People with MEN 1 also have tumors in the parathyroid glands and may have tumors in their pituitary glands.\nAbout 25% of people who have gastrinomas have them as part of Men 1. They may also have tumors in the pancreas and other organs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will base a diagnosis on the following:\n\n    Medical history. Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and review your medical history.\n    \n    Blood tests. A sample of your blood is analyzed to see whether you have elevated gastrin levels. While elevated gastrin may indicate tumors in your pancreas or duodenum, it can also be caused by other conditions. For example, gastrin may also be elevated if your stomach isn't making acid, or you're taking acid-reducing medications, such as proton pump inhibitors.\n    You need to fast before this test and may need to stop taking any acid-reducing medications to get the most accurate measure of your gastrin levels. Because gastrin levels can fluctuate, this test may be repeated a few times.\n    Your doctor may also perform a secretin stimulation test. For this test, your doctor first measures your gastrin levels, then gives you an injection of the hormone secretin and measures gastrin levels again. If you have Zollinger-Ellison, your gastrin levels will increase even more.\n    \n    Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. After you're sedated, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible instrument with a light and video camera (endoscope) down your throat and into your stomach and duodenum to look for ulcers. Through the endoscope, your doctor may remove a tissue sample (biopsy) from your duodenum to help detect the presence of gastrin-producing tumors. Your doctor will ask you not to eat anything after midnight the night before the test.\n    \n    Endoscopic ultrasound. In this procedure, your doctor examines your stomach, duodenum and pancreas with an endoscope fitted with an ultrasound probe. The probe allows for closer inspection, making it easier to spot tumors.\n    It's also possible to remove a tissue sample through the endoscope. You'll need to fast after midnight the night before this test, and you'll be sedated during the test.\n    \n    Imaging tests. Your doctor may use imaging techniques such as a nuclear scan called somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. This test uses radioactive tracers to help locate tumors. Other helpful imaging tests include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT scanning.\nMore InformationCT scanEndoscopic ultrasoundMRIUltrasoundShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome addresses the hormone-secreting tumors as well as the ulcers they cause.\n        \n            \n            Treatment of tumorsAn operation to remove the tumors that occur in Zollinger-Ellison requires a skilled surgeon because the tumors are often small and difficult to locate. If you have just one tumor, your doctor may be able to remove it surgically, but surgery may not be an option if you have multiple tumors or tumors that have spread to your liver. On the other hand, even if you have multiple tumors, your doctor still may recommend removing a single large tumor.\nIn some cases, doctors advise other treatments to control tumor growth, including:\n\n    Removing as much of a liver tumor as possible (debulking)\n    Attempting to destroy the tumor by cutting off the blood supply (embolization) or by using heat to destroy cancer cells (radiofrequency ablation)\n    Injecting drugs into the tumor to relieve cancer symptoms\n    Using chemotherapy to try to slow tumor growth\n    Having a liver transplant\n\n        \n            \n            Treatment of excess acidExcess acid production can almost always be controlled. Medications known as proton pump inhibitors are the first line of treatment. These are effective medications for decreasing acid production in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\nProton pump inhibitors are powerful drugs that reduce acid by blocking the action of the tiny \"pumps\" within acid-secreting cells. Commonly prescribed medications include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and esomeprazole (Nexium).\nLong-term use of prescription proton pump inhibitors, especially in people age 50 and older, has been associated with an increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist and spine, according to the Food and Drug Administration. This risk is small and should be weighed against the acid-blocking benefits of these medications.\nOctreotide (Sandostatin), a medication similar to the hormone somatostatin, may counteract the effects of gastrin and be helpful for some people.More InformationChemotherapyLiver transplantRadiofrequency ablation for cancer\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

But the sequence of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is clear. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors (gastrinomas) form in your pancreas or duodenum or at other sites such as the lymph nodes adjacent to your pancreas.\nYour pancreas sits behind and below your stomach.

The pancreas also produces several hormones including insulin, a hormone that helps to control your blood glucose.\nDigestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum, the part of the small intestine next to your stomach. This is where digestion reaches its peak.\nThe tumors that occur with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are made up of cells that secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Increased gastrin makes the stomach produce far too much acid.

Although these cases present a diagnostic challenge, the coordination of care to address all of the medical, developmental or behavioral problems will likely be similar.More InformationGenetic testing\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Although there is no cure for DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome), treatments can usually correct critical problems, such as a heart defect or cleft palate. Other health issues and developmental, mental health or behavioral problems can be addressed or monitored as needed.\nTreatments and therapy for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may include interventions for:\n\n    Hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism can usually be managed with calcium supplements and vitamin D supplements.\n    Heart defects. Most heart defects associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome require surgery soon after birth to repair the heart and improve the supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n    Limited thymus gland function. If your child has some thymic function, infections may be frequent, but not necessarily severe. These infections \u2014 usually colds and ear infections \u2014 are generally treated as they would be in any child. Most children with limited thymic function follow the normal schedule of vaccines. For most children with moderate thymus impairment, immune system function improves with age.\n    Severe thymus dysfunction. If the impairment of the thymus is severe or there's no thymus, your child is at risk of a number of severe infections. Treatment requires a transplant of thymus tissue, specialized cells from bone marrow or specialized disease-fighting blood cells.\n    Cleft palate. A cleft palate or other abnormalities of the palate and lip can usually be surgically repaired.\n    Overall development. Your child will likely benefit from a range of therapies, including speech therapy, occupational therapy and developmental therapy. In the United States, early intervention programs providing these types of therapy are usually available through a state or county health department.\n    Mental health care. Treatment may be recommended if your child is later diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, depression, or other mental health or behavioral disorders.\n    Management of other conditions. These may include addressing feeding and growth issues, hearing or vision problems, and other medical conditions.\n\n        \n            \n            Health care teamBecause 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can result in so many problems, several specialists will likely be involved in diagnosing specific conditions, recommending treatments and providing care. This team will evolve as your child's needs change. Specialists on your care team may include these professionals and others, as needed:\n\n    Children's health specialist (pediatrician)\n    Expert in inherited disorders (geneticist)\n    Heart specialist (cardiologist)\n    Immune system specialist (immunologist)\n    Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist\n    Infectious disease specialist\n    Hormone disorder specialist (endocrinologist)\n    Surgeon who specializes in correcting such conditions as a cleft palate (oral and maxillofacial surgeon)\n    Surgeon who specializes in correcting heart defects (cardiovascular surgeon)\n    Occupational therapist to help develop practical, everyday skills\n    Speech therapist to help improve verbal skills and articulation\n    Developmental therapist to help develop age-appropriate behaviors, social skills and interpersonal skills\n    Mental health professional, such as a pediatric psychiatrist or psychologist\nMore InformationBone marrow transplantPsychotherapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},
{"Diseases": "Absence seizure", "Symptoms": "An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 20 seconds, without any confusion, headache or drowsiness afterward. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include:\n\n    Sudden stop in motion without falling\n    Lip smacking\n    Eyelid flutters\n    Chewing motions\n    Finger rubbing\n    Small movements of both hands\n\nAfterward, there's no memory of the incident. Some people have many episodes daily, which interfere with school or daily activities.\nA child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices the seizures, because they're so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of this disorder. Teachers may comment about a child's inability to pay attention or that a child is often daydreaming.\nWhen to see a doctor\nContact your doctor:\n\n\n\n    The first time you notice a seizure\n    If this is a new type of seizure\n    If the seizures continue to occur despite taking anti-seizure medication\n\nContact 911 or emergency services in your area:\n\n    If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours \u2014 activities such as eating or moving without awareness \u2014 or prolonged confusion, possible symptoms of a condition called absence status epilepticus\n    After any seizure lasting more than five minutes\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\t\n\t\t@font-face {\n\t\t\tfont-family: mayo-form-icons;\n\t\t\tsrc:

from nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The brain's nerve cells normally send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them.\nIn people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern.\nPeople who have seizures may also have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another (neurotransmitters).\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    EEG brain activity\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tEEG brain activity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEEG brain activity\n\t\t\t\tAn EEG records the electrical activity of your brain via electrodes affixed to your scalp. EEG results show changes in brain activity that may be useful in diagnosing brain conditions, especially epilepsy and other seizure disorders.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nYour doctor will ask for a detailed description of the seizures and conduct a physical exam. Tests may include:\n\n    \n    Electroencephalography (EEG). This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small electrodes attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap.\n    Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the normal pattern.\n    \n    Brain scans. In absence seizures, brain-imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will be normal. But tests such as MRI can produce detailed images of the brain, which can help rule out other problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Because your child will need to hold still for long periods, talk with your doctor about the possible use of sedation.\nMore InformationEEG (electroencephalogram)MRI\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Your doctor likely will start at the lowest dose of anti-seizure medication possible and increase the dosage as needed to control the seizures. Children may be able to taper off anti-seizure medications, under a doctor's supervision, after they've been seizure-free for two years.\nDrugs prescribed for absence seizure include:\n\n    Ethosuximide (Zarontin). This is the drug most doctors start with for absence seizures. In most cases, seizures respond well to this drug. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, trouble sleeping, hyperactivity.\n    \n    Valproic acid (Depakene). Girls who continue to need medication into adulthood should discuss potential risks of valproic acid with their doctors. Valproic acid has been associated with higher risk of birth defects in babies, and doctors advise women against using it during pregnancy or while trying to conceive.\n    Doctors may recommend the use of valproic acid in children who have both absence and grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures.\n    \n    Lamotrigine (Lamictal). Some studies show this drug to be less effective than ethosuximide or valproic acid, but it has fewer side effects. Side effects may include rash and nausea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t@font-face {\n\t\t\tfont-family: mayo-form-icons;\n\t\t\tsrc:

{"Diseases": "Bartholin's cyst", "Symptoms": "If you have a small, noninfected Bartholin's cyst, you may not notice it. If the cyst grows, you might feel a lump or mass near your vaginal opening. Although a cyst is usually painless, it can be tender.\nA full-blown infection of a Bartholin's cyst can occur in a matter of days. If the cyst becomes infected, you may experience:\n\n    A tender, painful lump near the vaginal opening\n    Discomfort while walking or sitting\n    Pain during intercourse\n    Fever\n\nA Bartholin's cyst or abscess typically occurs on only one side of the vaginal opening.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorCall your doctor if you have a painful lump near the opening of your vagina that doesn't improve after two or three days of self-care \u2014 for instance, soaking the area in warm water (sitz bath). If the pain is severe, make an appointment with your doctor right away.\nAlso call your doctor promptly if you find a new lump near your vaginal opening and you're older than 40. Although rare, such a lump may be a sign of a more serious problem, such as cancer.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Experts believe that the cause of a Bartholin's cyst is a backup of fluid. Fluid may accumulate when the opening of the gland (duct) becomes obstructed, perhaps caused by infection or injury.\nA Bartholin's cyst can become infected, forming an abscess. A number of bacteria may cause the infection, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bacteria that cause sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To diagnose a Bartholin's cyst, your doctor may:\n\n    Ask questions about your medical history\n    Perform a pelvic exam\n    Take a sample of secretions from your vagina or cervix to test for a sexually transmitted infection\n    Recommend a test of the mass (biopsy) to check for cancerous cells if you're postmenopausal or over 40\n\nIf cancer is a concern, your doctor may refer you to a gynecologist who specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system.More InformationNeedle biopsyPelvic exam\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Often a Bartholin's cyst requires no treatment \u2014 especially if the cyst causes no signs or symptoms. When needed, treatment depends on the size of the cyst, your discomfort level and whether it's infected, which can result in an abscess.\nTreatment options your doctor may recommend include:\n\n    Sitz baths. Soaking in a tub filled with a few inches of warm water (sitz bath) several times a day for three or four days may help a small, infected cyst to rupture and drain on its own.\n    \n    Surgical drainage. You may need surgery to drain a cyst that's infected or very large. Drainage of a cyst can be done using local anesthesia or sedation.\n    For the procedure, your doctor makes a small incision in the cyst, allows it to drain, and then places a small rubber tube (catheter) in the incision. The catheter stays in place for up to six weeks to keep the incision open and allow complete drainage.\n    \n    Antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if your cyst is infected or if testing reveals that you have a sexually transmitted infection. But if the abscess is drained properly, you may not need antibiotics.\n    Marsupialization. If cysts recur or bother you, a marsupialization (mahr-soo-pee-ul-ih-ZAY-shun) procedure may help. Your doctor places stitches on each side of a drainage incision to create a permanent opening less than 1/4-inch (about 6-millimeter) long. An inserted catheter may be placed to promote drainage for a few days after the procedure and to help prevent recurrence.\n\nRarely, for persistent cysts that aren't effectively treated by the above procedures, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the Bartholin's gland. Surgical removal is usually done in a hospital under general anesthesia. Surgical removal of the gland carries a greater risk of bleeding or complications after the procedure.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},
{"Diseases": "Hyperhidrosis", "Symptoms": "Most people sweat when they exercise or exert themselves, are in a hot environment, or are anxious or under stress. The excessive sweating experienced with hyperhidrosis far exceeds such normal sweating.\nThe type of hyperhidrosis that usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face causes at least one episode a week, during waking hours. And the sweating usually occurs on both sides of the body.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSometimes excessive sweating is a sign of a serious condition.\nSeek immediate medical attention if your heavy sweating is accompanied by lightheadedness, chest pain or nausea.\nSee your doctor if:\n\n    Sweating disrupts your daily routine\n    Sweating causes emotional distress or social withdrawal\n    You suddenly begin to sweat more than usual\n    You experience night sweats for no apparent reason\n\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Sweat glands\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSweat glands\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tSweat glands\r\n\t\t\t\tYour skin has two types of sweat glands: eccrine and apocrine. Eccrine glands occur over most of your body and open directly onto the surface of your skin. Apocrine glands open into the hair follicle, leading to the surface of the skin. Apocrine glands develop in areas abundant in hair follicles, such as on your scalp, armpits and groin.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweating is your body's mechanism to cool itself. Your nervous system automatically triggers your sweat glands when your body temperature rises. Sweating also normally occurs, especially on your palms, when you're nervous.\nThe most common form of hyperhidrosis is called primary focal (essential) hyperhidrosis. With this type, the nerves responsible for signaling your sweat glands become overactive, even though they haven't been triggered by physical activity or a rise in temperature. With stress or nervousness, the problem becomes even worse. This type usually affects your palms and soles and sometimes your face.\nThere is no medical cause for this type of hyperhidrosis. It may have a hereditary component, because it sometimes runs in families.\nSecondary hyperhidrosis occurs when excess sweating is due to a medical condition. It's the less common type. It's more likely to cause sweating all over your body. Conditions that may lead to heavy sweating include:\n\n    Diabetes\n    Menopause hot flashes\n    Thyroid problems\n    Low blood sugar\n    Some types of cancer\n    Heart attack\n    Nervous system disorders\n    Infections\n\nCertain medications also can lead to heavy sweating, as can opioid withdrawal.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During your appointment, your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms.

If no clear cause can be found, treatment focuses on controlling excessive sweating. Sometimes you may need to try a combination of treatments. And even if your sweating improves after treatment, it may recur.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsDrugs used to treat hyperhidrosis include:\n\n    Prescription antiperspirant. Your doctor may prescribe an antiperspirant with aluminum chloride (Drysol, Xerac Ac). This product can cause skin and eye irritation. It's usually applied to the affected skin before you go to bed. Then you wash the product off when you get up, taking care to not get any in your eyes. If your skin becomes irritated, hydrocortisone cream might help.\n    Prescription creams. A prescription cream that contains glycopyrrolate may help hyperhidrosis that affects the face and head.\n    Nerve-blocking medications. Some oral medications block the chemicals that permit certain nerves to communicate with each other. This can reduce sweating in some people. Possible side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision and bladder problems.\n    Antidepressants. Some medications used for depression can also decrease sweating. In addition, they may help decrease the anxiety that worsens the hyperhidrosis.\n    Botulinum toxin injections. Treatment with botulinum toxin (Botox, Myobloc, others) temporarily blocks the nerves that cause sweating. Your skin will be iced or anesthetized first. Each affected area of your body will need several injections. The effects last six to 12 months, and then the treatment needs to be repeated. This treatment can be painful, and some people experience temporary muscle weakness in the treated area.\n\n        \n            \n            Surgical and other proceduresOther hyperhidrosis treatments include:\n\n    Microwave therapy. With this therapy, a device that delivers microwave energy is used to destroy sweat glands. Treatments involve two 20- to 30-minute sessions, three months apart. Possible side effects are a change in skin sensation and some discomfort. This therapy may be expensive and not widely available.\n    Sweat gland removal. If excessive sweating occurs just in your armpits, removing the sweat glands there may help. A minimally invasive technique called suction curettage may be an option, too, if you aren't responding to other treatments.\n    Nerve surgery (sympathectomy).

In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from multiple locations in the upper chambers \u2014 most often from the pulmonary veins. The atrioventricular (AV) node doesn't stop the extra signals from entering the ventricles. The result is a rapid and chaotic heartbeat.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAtrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that occurs when the two upper chambers of your heart experience chaotic electrical signals. The result is a fast and irregular heart rhythm. The heart rate in atrial fibrillation may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute. The normal range for a heart rate is 60 to 100 beats a minute.\nYour heart is made up of four chambers \u2014 two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Within the upper right chamber of your heart (right atrium) is a group of cells called the sinus node. This is your heart's natural pacemaker. The sinus node produces the signal that normally starts each heartbeat.\nNormally, the signal travels through the two upper heart chambers, and then through a connecting pathway between the upper and lower chambers called the atrioventricular (AV) node. The movement of the signal causes your heart to squeeze (contract), sending blood to your heart and body.\nIn atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of your heart are chaotic. As a result, they quiver. The AV node \u2014 the electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles \u2014 is bombarded with impulses trying to get through to the ventricles.\nThe ventricles also beat rapidly, but not as rapidly as the atria, as not all the impulses get through.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Possible causes of atrial fibrillationAbnormalities or damage to the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation.

Sometimes you may have atrial flutter that develops into atrial fibrillation and vice versa.\nThe risk factors for and the symptoms and causes of atrial flutter are similar to those of atrial fibrillation. For example, strokes are also a concern in someone with atrial flutter.

Generally, the treatment goals for atrial fibrillation are to:\n\n    Reset the rhythm or control the rate\n    Prevent blood clots, which may decrease the risk of a stroke\n\nThe strategy you and your doctor choose depends on many factors, including whether you have other problems with your heart and if you're able to take medications that can control your heart rhythm. In some cases, you may need a more invasive treatment, such as medical procedures using catheters or surgery.\nIn some people, a specific event or an underlying condition, such as a thyroid disorder, may trigger atrial fibrillation. Treating the condition causing atrial fibrillation may help relieve your heart rhythm problems.

To correct your condition, doctors may be able to reset your heart to its regular rhythm (sinus rhythm) using a procedure called cardioversion, depending on the underlying cause of atrial fibrillation and how long you've had it.\nCardioversion can be done in two ways:\n\n    \n    Electrical cardioversion. In this brief procedure, an electrical shock is delivered to your heart through paddles or patches placed on your chest. The shock stops your heart's electrical activity for a short moment. The goal is to reset your heart's normal rhythm.\n    You will be given a sedative before the procedure, so you shouldn't feel the electric shock. You may also receive medications to help restore a normal heartbeat (anti-arrhythmics) before the procedure.\n    \n    \n    Cardioversion with drugs. This form of cardioversion uses medications called anti-arrhythmics to help restore normal sinus rhythm. Depending on your heart condition, you may receive medications through an IV or by mouth to help return your heart to normal rhythm.\n    This is often done in the hospital with continuous monitoring of your heart rate. If your heart rhythm returns to normal, your doctor often will prescribe the same anti-arrhythmic medication or a similar one to try to prevent more spells of atrial fibrillation.\n    \n\nBefore cardioversion, you may be given warfarin or another blood-thinning medication for several weeks to reduce the risk of blood clots and strokes. If your episode of atrial fibrillation lasted more than 48 hours, you may need to take this type of medication for at least a month after the procedure to prevent blood clots in the heart.\n        \n            \n            Maintaining a normal heart rhythmAfter electrical cardioversion, your doctor may prescribe anti-arrhythmic medications to help prevent future episodes of atrial fibrillation. Medications may include:\n\n    Dofetilide\n    Flecainide\n    Propafenone\n    Amiodarone\n    Sotalol\n\nAlthough these drugs may help maintain a normal heart rhythm, they can cause side effects, including:\n\n    Nausea\n    Dizziness\n    Fatigue\n\nRarely, they may cause ventricular arrhythmias \u2014 life-threatening rhythm disturbances originating in the heart's lower chambers. These medications may be needed indefinitely. Even with medications, there is a chance of another episode of atrial fibrillation.\n        \n            \n            Heart rate controlYou may be prescribed medications to control how fast your heart beats and restore it to a normal rate.\n\n    Digoxin. This medication may control the heart rate at rest, but not as well during activity. Most people need additional or alternative medications, such as calcium channel blockers or beta blockers.\n    Beta blockers. These medications can help to slow the heart rate at rest and during activity. They may cause side effects such as low blood pressure (hypotension).\n    Calcium channel blockers. These medicines also can control your heart rate, but may need to be avoided if you have heart failure or low blood pressure.\n\n        \n            \n            Catheter and surgical procedures\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Catheter ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins to treat atrial fibrillation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCatheter ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins to treat atrial fibrillation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCatheter ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins to treat atrial fibrillation\n\t\t\t\tAtrial fibrillation is often caused by rapidly discharging triggers, or \"hot spots.\" In catheter ablation to treat atrial fibrillation, a doctor inserts long, thin tubes (catheters) into your groin and guides them through blood vessels to your heart. The electrodes at the tips of the catheters help your doctor determine where these triggers are located. Electrodes at the catheter tips can use radiofrequency energy, extreme cold (cryotherapy) or heat to destroy these triggers, scarring the tissue so that the erratic signals are normalized.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    AV node ablation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAV node ablation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAV node ablation\n\t\t\t\tIn atrioventricular (AV) node ablation, doctors use heat (radiofrequency) energy to destroy the electrical connection between the upper and lower heart chambers (AV node), blocking the heart's electrical signals. Once the AV node is destroyed, doctors then implant a small medical device to maintain your heart rhythm (pacemaker).\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nSometimes medications or cardioversion to control atrial fibrillation doesn't work. In those cases, your doctor may recommend a procedure to destroy the area of heart tissue that's causing the erratic electrical signals and restore your heart to a normal rhythm. These options can include:\n\n    \n    Catheter ablation. During this procedure, a doctor inserts long, thin tubes (catheters) into your groin and guides them through blood vessels to your heart. The catheter's tip produces radiofrequency energy, extreme cold (cryotherapy) or heat to destroy areas of heart tissue that are causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Scar tissue forms, which helps signaling return to normal. Cardiac ablation may correct the arrhythmia without the need for medications or implantable devices.\n    Your doctor may recommend this procedure if you have atrial fibrillation and an otherwise normal heart and medication has not improved your symptoms. It may also be helpful for heart failure patients who have an implanted device and cannot take or tolerate anti-arrhythmic medications.\n    \n    \n    Maze procedure. There are several variations of the maze procedure. The doctor may use a scalpel, radiofrequency or extreme cold (cryotherapy) to create a pattern of scar tissue that interferes with stray electrical impulses that cause atrial fibrillation.\n    The maze procedures have a high success rate, but atrial fibrillation may come back. If this happens, you may need another cardiac ablation or other heart treatment.\n    Because the surgical maze procedure (using a scalpel) requires open-heart surgery, it's generally reserved for people who don't get better with other treatments or when it can be done during a necessary heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or heart valve repair.\n    \n    Atrioventricular (AV) node ablation. If medications or other forms of catheter ablation don't work or cause side effects, or if you're not a good candidate for these therapies, AV node ablation may be an option. The procedure involves using a catheter to deliver radiofrequency energy to the pathway (AV node) connecting the upper and lower heart chambers.\n    The procedure destroys a small area of heart tissue, preventing abnormal signaling. However, the upper chambers of the heart (atria) will still quiver. You'll need a pacemaker to be implanted to keep the lower chambers (ventricles) beating properly. You'll need to take blood thinners after this procedure to reduce the risk of a stroke due to atrial fibrillation.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Preventing blood clotsMany people with atrial fibrillation or those who are undergoing certain treatments for atrial fibrillation are at especially high risk of blood clots that can lead to a stroke. The risk is even higher if other heart disease is present along with atrial fibrillation.\nAnticoagulants\nYour doctor may prescribe blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) such as:\n\n    Warfarin. Warfarin may be prescribed to prevent blood clots. If you're prescribed warfarin, carefully follow your doctor's instructions. Warfarin is a powerful medication that may cause dangerous bleeding. You'll need to have regular blood tests to monitor warfarin's effects.\n    Newer anticoagulants. Several newer blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) are available to prevent strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. These medications include dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. They are shorter acting than warfarin and usually don't require regular blood tests or monitoring by your doctor. These medications aren't approved for people who have mechanical heart valves.\n\nMany people have spells of atrial fibrillation and don't even know it \u2014 so you may need lifelong anticoagulants even after your rhythm has been restored to normal.\nLeft atrial appendage closure\nYour doctor may also consider a procedure called left atrial appendage closure.\nIn this procedure, doctors insert a catheter through a vein in the leg and eventually guide it to the upper left heart chamber (left atrium). A device called a left atrial appendage closure device is then inserted through the catheter to close a small sac (appendage) in the left atrium.\nThis may reduce the risk of blood clots in certain people with atrial fibrillation, as many blood clots that occur in atrial fibrillation form in the left atrial appendage. Candidates for this procedure may include those who don't have heart valve problems, who have an increased risk of blood clots and bleeding, and who are aren't able to take anticoagulants. Your doctor will evaluate you and determine if you're a candidate for the procedure.More InformationAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAtrial fibrillation ablationAV node ablationCardiac ablationMaze procedureMinimally invasive heart surgeryPulmonary vein isolationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillationShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives.\nIn older adults, a sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying disease requiring medical attention.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers and other skin products can cause a serious reaction.

Bacteria can trigger inflammation and infection resulting in more severe acne.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFour main factors cause acne:\n\n    Excess oil (sebum) production\n    Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells\n    Bacteria\n    Inflammation\n\nAcne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.\nThe follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air.\nPimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne.\nCertain things may trigger or worsen acne:\n\n    Hormonal changes. Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too.\n    Certain medications. Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium.\n    Diet. Studies indicate that consuming certain foods \u2014 including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips \u2014 may worsen acne. Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions.\n    Stress. Stress doesn't cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Acne mythsThese factors have little effect on acne:\n\n    Chocolate and greasy foods. Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne.\n    Hygiene. Acne isn't caused by dirty skin. In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse.\n    Cosmetics. Cosmetics don't necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. Nonoily cosmetics don't interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs.\nMore InformationAdult acne: Can natural hormone treatments help?\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "", "Treatment": "If you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for several weeks and they haven't helped, ask your doctor about prescription-strength medications. A dermatologist can help you:\n\n    Control your acne\n    Avoid scarring or other damage to your skin\n    Make scars less noticeable\n\nAcne medications work by reducing oil production and swelling or by treating bacterial infection. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely.\nThe treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are often used in combination. Treatment options for pregnant women are limited due to the risk of side effects.\nTalk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering. And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves.\n        \n            \n            Topical medicationsThe most common topical prescription medications for acne are:\n\n    \n    Retinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.\n    Topical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with skin of color. Adapalene may be tolerated best.\n    \n    Antibiotics. These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance. Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, others) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin). Topical antibiotics alone aren't recommended.\n    \n    Azelaic acid and salicylic acid. Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast. It has antibacterial properties. A 20% azelaic acid cream or gel seems to be as effective as many conventional acne treatments when used twice a day. Prescription azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) is an option during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne. Side effects include skin redness and minor skin irritation.\n    Salicylic acid may help prevent plugged hair follicles and is available as both wash-off and leave-on products. Studies showing its effectiveness are limited. Side effects include skin discoloration and minor skin irritation.\n    \n    Dapsone. Dapsone (Aczone) 5% gel twice daily is recommended for inflammatory acne, especially in women with acne. Side effects include redness and dryness.\n\nEvidence is not strong in support of using zinc, sulfur, nicotinamide, resorcinol, sulfacetamide sodium or aluminum chloride in topical treatments for acne.\n        \n            \n            Oral medications\n    \n    Antibiotics. For moderate to severe acne, you may need oral antibiotics to reduce bacteria. Usually the first choice for treating acne is a tetracycline (minocycline, doxycycline) or a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin). A macrolide might be an option for people who can't take tetracyclines, including pregnant women and children under 8 years old.\n    Oral antibiotics should be used for the shortest time possible to prevent antibiotic resistance. And they should be combined with other drugs, such as benzoyl peroxide, to reduce the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.\n    Severe side effects from the use of antibiotics to treat acne are uncommon. These drugs do increase your skin's sun sensitivity.\n    \n    \n    Combined oral contraceptives. Four combined oral contraceptives are approved by the FDA for acne therapy in women who also wish to use them for contraception. They are products that combine progestin and estrogen (Ortho Tri-Cyclen 21, Yaz, others). You may not see the benefit of this treatment for a few months, so using other acne medications with it for the first few weeks may help.\n    Common side effects of combined oral contraceptives are weight gain, breast tenderness and nausea. These drugs are also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular problems, breast cancer and cervical cancer.\n    \n    Anti-androgen agents. The drug spironolactone (Aldactone) may be considered for women and adolescent girls if oral antibiotics aren't helping. It works by blocking the effect of androgen hormones on the oil-producing glands. Possible side effects include breast tenderness and painful periods.\n    \n    Isotretinoin. Isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, others) is a derivative of vitamin A. It may be prescribed for people whose moderate or severe acne hasn't responded to other treatments.\n    Potential side effects of oral isotretinoin include inflammatory bowel disease, depression and severe birth defects. All people receiving isotretinoin must participate in an FDA-approved risk management program. And they'll need to see their doctors regularly to monitor for side effects.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            TherapiesFor some people, the following therapies might be helpful, either alone or in combination with medications.\n\n    Light therapy. A variety of light-based therapies have been tried with some success. Most will require multiple visits to your doctor's office. Further study is needed to determine the ideal method, light source and dose.\n    Chemical peel. This procedure uses repeated applications of a chemical solution, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid or retinoic acid. This treatment is for mild acne. It might improve the appearance of the skin, though the change is not long lasting and repeat treatments are usually needed.\n    Drainage and extraction. Your doctor may use special tools to gently remove whiteheads and blackheads (comedos) or cysts that haven't cleared up with topical medications. This technique temporarily improves the appearance of your skin, but it might also cause scarring.\n    Steroid injection. Nodular and cystic lesions can be treated by injecting a steroid drug into them. This therapy has resulted in rapid improvement and decreased pain. Side effects may include skin thinning and discoloration in the treated area.\n\n        \n            \n            Treating childrenMost studies of acne drugs have involved people 12 years of age or older. Increasingly, younger children are getting acne as well. The FDA has expanded the number of topical products approved for use in children. And guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology indicate that topical benzoyl peroxide, adapalene and tretinoin in preadolescent children are effective and don't cause increased risk of side effects.\nIf your child has acne, consider consulting a pediatric dermatologist. Ask about drugs to avoid in children, appropriate doses, drug interactions, side effects, and how treatment may affect a child's growth and development.More InformationAcne treatments: Medical procedures may help clear skinAcne scars: What's the best treatment?Birth control pills for acne?Chemical peelDermabrasionLaser resurfacingLight therapyTake action against acneShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

One out of 400 babies is born with a chest wall that doesn't form properly and becomes concave. Kids with pectus routinely have surgery. Adults have either had to live with it or face major more complicated operations. Now, doctors at Mayo Clinic are performing the same surgery for kids on adults and improving the lives of many people.\nWe're doing a repair of a deformity of the chest wall, called a pectus excavatum.\nDr. Dawn Jaroszewski is a thoracic surgeon, who specializes in pectus repair.\nIt was once thought that these deformities were all cosmetic and it didn't affect the patient at all. And now, we're finding out that people can have very severe heart and lung problems.\nA couple of years ago, I developed a little bit of a wheezey cough.\nMichelle Kroeger had a mild case of pectus that got worse over time.\nWhen I'd be running, it'd be harder and harder. I'd get more short of breath. And then I was getting more palpitations in my heart, chest pain.\nYou can see here this very narrow space between her spine here and her chest.\nThe concave chest was compressing Michelle's lung, and it shifted her heart to the left. Traditional surgery for adults means major surgery, opening the chest, and remodeling the chest wall. But Dr. Jaroszewski uses a much less invasive technique that was once only used for children.\nFirst, Dr. Jaroszewski makes small incisions on either side of the patient. Then, guided by a small camera, she inserts bars that lift the chest wall into a more normal position.\nThis is an x-ray, which shows an adult two bars and a nice repair.\nThe bars are sort of like braces. Michelle will keep them for about two years. When they come out her chest will retain its new shape. Now, she can continue her busy life symptom free.\nMichelle says she got relief from symptoms almost immediately after surgery. The only drawback to having the bars in her chest, Michelle says, she sets off the metal detectors in airports, which to her is a small price to pay for a better quality of life.

If left untreated, here's how plaque can eventually advance to periodontitis:\n\n    Plaque forms on your teeth when starches and sugars in food interact with bacteria normally found in your mouth. Brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day removes plaque, but plaque re-forms quickly.\n    Plaque can harden under your gumline into tartar (calculus) if it stays on your teeth. Tartar is more difficult to remove and it's filled with bacteria. The longer plaque and tartar remain on your teeth, the more damage they can do. You can't get rid of tartar by brushing and flossing \u2014 you need a professional dental cleaning to remove it.\n    Plaque can cause gingivitis, the mildest form of gum disease. Gingivitis is irritation and inflammation of the part of your gum tissue around the base of your teeth (gingiva). Gingivitis can be reversed with professional treatment and good home oral care.\n    Ongoing gum inflammation can cause periodontitis, eventually causing pockets to develop between your gums and teeth that fill with plaque, tartar and bacteria. In time, these pockets become deeper, filling with more bacteria. If not treated, these deep infections cause a loss of tissue and bone, and ultimately you may lose one or more teeth. Also, ongoing chronic inflammation can put a strain on your immune system.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To determine whether you have periodontitis and how severe it is, your dentist may:\n\n    Review your medical history to identify any factors that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as smoking or taking certain medications that cause dry mouth.\n    Examine your mouth to look for plaque and tartar buildup and check for easy bleeding.\n    Measure the pocket depth of the groove between your gums and teeth by placing a dental probe beside your tooth beneath your gumline, usually at several sites throughout your mouth. In a healthy mouth, the pocket depth is usually between 1 and 3 millimeters (mm). Pockets deeper than 4 mm may indicate periodontitis. Pockets deeper than 5 mm cannot be cleaned well.\n    Take dental X-rays to check for bone loss in areas where your dentist observes deeper pocket depths.\n\nYour dentist may assign a stage and a grade to periodontitis based on the severity of the disease, the complexity of treatment, your risk factors and your health.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment may be performed by a periodontist, a dentist or a dental hygienist. The goal of periodontitis treatment is to thoroughly clean the pockets around teeth and prevent damage to surrounding bone. You have the best chance for successful treatment when you also adopt a daily routine of good oral care, manage health conditions that may impact dental health and stop tobacco use.\n        \n            \n            Nonsurgical treatmentsIf periodontitis isn't advanced, treatment may involve less invasive procedures, including:\n\n    Scaling. Scaling removes tartar and bacteria from your tooth surfaces and beneath your gums. It may be performed using instruments, a laser or an ultrasonic device.\n    Root planing. Root planing smooths the root surfaces, discouraging further buildup of tartar and bacteria, and removes bacterial byproducts that contribute to inflammation and delay healing or reattachment of the gum to the tooth surfaces.\n    Antibiotics. Topical or oral antibiotics can help control bacterial infection. Topical antibiotics can include antibiotic mouth rinses or insertion of gels containing antibiotics in the space between your teeth and gums or into pockets after deep cleaning. However, oral antibiotics may be necessary to completely eliminate infection-causing bacteria.\n\n        \n            \n            Surgical treatmentsIf you have advanced periodontitis, treatment may require dental surgery, such as:\n\n    Flap surgery (pocket reduction surgery). Your periodontist makes tiny incisions in your gum so that a section of gum tissue can be lifted back, exposing the roots for more effective scaling and root planing. Because periodontitis often causes bone loss, the underlying bone may be recontoured before the gum tissue is sutured back in place. After you heal, it's easier to clean these areas and maintain healthy gum tissue.\n    Soft tissue grafts. When you lose gum tissue, your gumline recedes. You may need to have some of the damaged soft tissue reinforced. This is usually done by removing a small amount of tissue from the roof of your mouth (palate) or using tissue from another donor source and attaching it to the affected site. This can help reduce further gum recession, cover exposed roots and give your teeth a more pleasing appearance.\n    Bone grafting. This procedure is performed when periodontitis has destroyed the bone surrounding your tooth root. The graft may be composed of small fragments of your own bone, or the bone may be synthetic or donated. The bone graft helps prevent tooth loss by holding your tooth in place. It also serves as a platform for the regrowth of natural bone.\n    Guided tissue regeneration. This allows the regrowth of bone that was destroyed by bacteria. In one approach, your dentist places a special piece of biocompatible fabric between existing bone and your tooth. The material prevents unwanted tissue from entering the healing area, allowing bone to grow back instead.\n    Tissue-stimulating proteins. Another technique involves applying a special gel to a diseased tooth root. This gel contains the same proteins found in developing tooth enamel and stimulates the growth of healthy bone and tissue.\n\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Hypothyroidism may be due to a number of factors, including:\n\n    \n    Autoimmune disease. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disorder known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Autoimmune disorders occur when your immune system produces antibodies that attack your own tissues. Sometimes this process involves your thyroid gland.\n    Scientists aren't sure why this happens, but it's likely a combination of factors, such as your genes and an environmental trigger. However it happens, these antibodies affect the thyroid's ability to produce hormones.\n    \n    Over-response to hyperthyroidism treatment. People who produce too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) are often treated with radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications. The goal of these treatments is to get thyroid function back to normal. But sometimes, correcting hyperthyroidism can end up lowering thyroid hormone production too much, resulting in permanent hypothyroidism.\n    Thyroid surgery. Removing all or a large portion of your thyroid gland can diminish or halt hormone production. In that case, you'll need to take thyroid hormone for life.\n    Radiation therapy. Radiation used to treat cancers of the head and neck can affect your thyroid gland and may lead to hypothyroidism.\n    Medications. A number of medications can contribute to hypothyroidism. One such medication is lithium, which is used to treat certain psychiatric disorders. If you're taking medication, ask your doctor about its effect on your thyroid gland.\n\nLess often, hypothyroidism may result from one of the following:\n\n    Congenital disease. Some babies are born with a defective thyroid gland or no thyroid gland. In most cases, the thyroid gland didn't develop normally for unknown reasons, but some children have an inherited form of the disorder. Often, infants with congenital hypothyroidism appear normal at birth. That's one reason why most states now require newborn thyroid screening.\n    Pituitary disorder. A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to produce enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) \u2014 usually because of a benign tumor of the pituitary gland.\n    Pregnancy. Some women develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy (postpartum hypothyroidism), often because they produce antibodies to their own thyroid gland. Left untreated, hypothyroidism increases the risk of miscarriage, premature delivery and preeclampsia \u2014 a condition that causes a significant rise in a woman's blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy. It can also seriously affect the developing fetus.\n    Iodine deficiency. The trace mineral iodine \u2014 found primarily in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt \u2014 is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism, and too much iodine can worsen hypothyroidism in people who already have the condition. In some parts of the world, iodine deficiency is common, but the addition of iodine to table salt has virtually eliminated this problem in the United States.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "In general, your doctor may test for an underactive thyroid if you are feeling increasingly tired, have dry skin, constipation and weight gain, or have had previous thyroid problems or a goiter.\n        \n            \n            Blood testsDiagnosis of hypothyroidism is based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests that measure the level of TSH and sometimes the level of the thyroid hormone thyroxine. A low level of thyroxine and high level of TSH indicate an underactive thyroid. That's because your pituitary produces more TSH in an effort to stimulate your thyroid gland into producing more thyroid hormone.\nDoctors can diagnose thyroid disorders much earlier than in the past \u2014 often before you experience symptoms. Because the TSH test is the best screening test, your doctor will likely check TSH first and follow with a thyroid hormone test if needed.\nTSH tests also play an important role in managing hypothyroidism. They help your doctor determine the right dosage of medication, both initially and over time.\nIn addition, TSH tests are used to help diagnose a condition called subclinical hypothyroidism, which usually causes no outward signs or symptoms. In this condition, you have normal blood levels of triiodothyronine and thyroxine, but higher than normal levels of TSH.\nThere are certain factors that can affect blood tests for thyroid problems. One is the blood-thinning medication called heparin. Another is biotin, a vitamin taken as a stand-alone supplement or as part of a multivitamin. Let your doctor know about any medications or supplements you take before having blood tests done.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Standard treatment for hypothyroidism involves daily use of the synthetic thyroid hormone levothyroxine (Levo-T, Synthroid, others). This oral medication restores adequate hormone levels, reversing the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.\nYou'll likely start to feel better soon after you start treatment. The medication gradually lowers cholesterol levels elevated by the disease and may reverse any weight gain. Treatment with levothyroxine will likely be lifelong, but because the dosage you need may change, your doctor is likely to check your TSH level every year.\n        \n            \n            Determining proper dosage may take timeTo determine the right dosage of levothyroxine initially, your doctor generally checks your level of TSH after six to eight weeks. After that, blood levels are generally checked six months later. Excessive amounts of the hormone can cause side effects, such as:\n\n    Increased appetite\n    Insomnia\n    Heart palpitations\n    Shakiness\n\nIf you have coronary artery disease or severe hypothyroidism, your doctor may start treatment with a smaller amount of medication and gradually increase the dosage. Progressive hormone replacement allows your heart to adjust to the increase in metabolism.\nLevothyroxine causes virtually no side effects when used in the appropriate dose and is relatively inexpensive. If you change brands, let your doctor know to ensure you're still receiving the right dosage.\nAlso, don't skip doses or stop taking the drug because you're feeling better. If you do, the symptoms of hypothyroidism will gradually return.\n        \n            \n            Proper absorption of levothyroxineCertain medications, supplements and even some foods may affect your ability to absorb levothyroxine. Talk to your doctor if you eat large amounts of soy products or a high-fiber diet or you take other medications, such as:\n\n    Iron supplements or multivitamins that contain iron\n    Aluminum hydroxide, which is found in some antacids\n    Calcium supplements\n\nLevothyroxine is best taken on an empty stomach at the same time every day. Ideally, you'll take the hormone in the morning and wait an hour before eating or taking other medications. If you take it at bedtime, wait four hours after your last meal or snack.\nIf you miss a dose of levothyroxine, take two pills the next day.\n        \n            \n            Subclinical hypothyroidismIf you have subclinical hypothyroidism, discuss treatment with your doctor. For a relatively mild increase in TSH, you probably won't benefit from thyroid hormone therapy, and treatment could even be harmful. On the other hand, for a higher TSH level, thyroid hormones may improve your cholesterol level, the pumping ability of your heart and your energy level.More InformationHypothyroidism dietHypothyroidism: Can calcium supplements interfere with treatment?Hypothyroidism: Should I take iodine supplements?Soy: Does it worsen hypothyroidism?Show more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Most doctors consider blood pressure too low only if it causes symptoms.\nSome experts define low blood pressure as readings lower than 90 mm Hg systolic or 60 mm Hg diastolic. If either number is below that, your pressure is lower than normal.\nA sudden fall in blood pressure can be dangerous. A change of just 20 mm Hg \u2014 a drop from 110 systolic to 90 mm Hg systolic, for example \u2014 can cause dizziness and fainting when the brain fails to receive enough blood. And big drops, such as those caused by uncontrolled bleeding, severe infections or allergic reactions, can be life-threatening.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Conditions that can cause low blood pressureMedical conditions that can cause low blood pressure include:\n\n    Pregnancy. Because the circulatory system expands rapidly during pregnancy, blood pressure is likely to drop. This is normal, and blood pressure usually returns to your pre-pregnancy level after you've given birth.\n    Heart problems. Some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack and heart failure.\n    Endocrine problems. Parathyroid disease, adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and, in some cases, diabetes can trigger low blood pressure.\n    Dehydration. When your body loses more water than it takes in, it can cause weakness, dizziness and fatigue. Fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea, overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise can lead to dehydration.\n    Blood loss. Losing a lot of blood, such as from a major injury or internal bleeding, reduces the amount of blood in your body, leading to a severe drop in blood pressure.\n    Severe infection (septicemia). When an infection in the body enters the bloodstream, it can lead to a life-threatening drop in blood pressure called septic shock.\n    Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Common triggers of this severe and potentially life-threatening reaction include foods, certain medications, insect venoms and latex. Anaphylaxis can cause breathing problems, hives, itching, a swollen throat and a dangerous drop in blood pressure.\n    Lack of nutrients in your diet. A lack of the vitamin B-12, folate and iron can keep your body from producing enough red blood cells (anemia), causing low blood pressure.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Medications that can cause low blood pressureSome medications can cause low blood pressure, including:\n\n    Water pills (diuretics), such as furosemide (Lasix) and hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide, others)\n    Alpha blockers, such as prazosin (Minipress)\n    Beta blockers, such as atenolol (Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL, others)\n    Drugs for Parkinson's disease, such as pramipexole (Mirapex) or those containing levodopa\n    Certain types of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants), including doxepin (Silenor) and imipramine (Tofranil)\n    Drugs for erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) or tadalafil (Adcirca, Alyq, Cialis), particularly when taken with the heart medication nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, others)\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Types of low blood pressureDoctors often break down low blood pressure (hypotension) into categories, depending on the causes and other factors. Some types of low blood pressure include:\n\n    \n    Low blood pressure on standing up (orthostatic or postural) hypotension). This is a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up from a sitting position or after lying down.\n    Gravity causes blood to pool in your legs when you stand. Ordinarily, your body compensates by increasing your heart rate and constricting blood vessels, thereby ensuring that enough blood returns to your brain.\n    But in people with orthostatic hypotension, this compensating mechanism fails and blood pressure falls, leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision and even fainting.\n    Orthostatic hypotension can occur for various reasons, including dehydration, prolonged bed rest, pregnancy, diabetes, heart problems, burns, excessive heat, large varicose veins and certain neurological disorders.\n    A number of medications also can cause orthostatic hypotension, particularly drugs used to treat high blood pressure \u2014 diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \u2014 as well as antidepressants and drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease and erectile dysfunction.\n    Orthostatic hypotension is especially common in older adults, but it also affects young, otherwise healthy people who stand up suddenly after sitting with their legs crossed for long periods or after squatting for a time.\n    \n    \n    Low blood pressure after eating (postprandial hypotension). This drop in blood pressure occurs one to two hours after eating and affects mostly older adults.\n    Blood flows to your digestive tract after you eat. Ordinarily, your body increases your heart rate and constricts certain blood vessels to help maintain normal blood pressure. But in some people these mechanisms fail, leading to dizziness, faintness and falls.\n    Postprandial hypotension is more likely to affect people with high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system disorders such as Parkinson's disease.\n    Eating small, low-carbohydrate meals; drinking more water; and avoiding alcohol might help reduce symptoms.\n    \n    Low blood pressure from faulty brain signals (neurally mediated hypotension). This disorder, which causes a blood pressure drop after standing for long periods, mostly affects young adults and children. It seems to occur because of a miscommunication between the heart and the brain.\n    Low blood pressure due to nervous system damage (multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension). Also called Shy-Drager syndrome, this rare disorder has many Parkinson disease-like symptoms. It causes progressive damage to the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and digestion. It's associated with having very high blood pressure while lying down.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Tilt table test\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTilt table test\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTilt table test\n\t\t\t\tYou begin by lying flat on a table.

For instance, when medication causes low blood pressure, treatment usually involves changing or stopping the medication or lowering the dose.\nIf it's not clear what's causing low blood pressure or no treatment exists, the goal is to raise your blood pressure and reduce signs and symptoms. Depending on your age, health and the type of low blood pressure you have, you can do this in several ways:\n\n    \n    Use more salt. Experts usually recommend limiting salt in your diet because sodium can raise blood pressure, sometimes dramatically. For people with low blood pressure, that can be a good thing.\n    But because excess sodium can lead to heart failure, especially in older adults, it's important to check with your doctor before increasing the salt in your diet.\n    \n    Drink more water. Fluids increase blood volume and help prevent dehydration, both of which are important in treating hypotension.\n    \n    Wear compression stockings. The elastic stockings commonly used to relieve the pain and swelling of varicose veins can help reduce the pooling of blood in your legs.\n    Some people tolerate elastic abdominal binders better than they do compression stockings.\n    \n    \n    Medications. Several medications can be used to treat low blood pressure that occurs when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension). For example, the drug fludrocortisone, which boosts your blood volume, is often used to treat this form of low blood pressure.\n    Doctors often use the drug midodrine (Orvaten) to raise standing blood pressure levels in people with chronic orthostatic hypotension.

Some of the more common knee injuries include:\n\n    ACL injury. An ACL injury is a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) \u2014 one of four ligaments that connect your shinbone to your thighbone. An ACL injury is particularly common in people who play basketball, soccer or other sports that require sudden changes in direction.\n    Fractures. The bones of the knee, including the kneecap (patella), can be broken during falls or auto accidents. Also, people whose bones have been weakened by osteoporosis can sometimes sustain a knee fracture simply by stepping wrong.\n    Torn meniscus. The meniscus is the tough, rubbery cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between your shinbone and thighbone. It can be torn if you suddenly twist your knee while bearing weight on it.\n    Knee bursitis. Some knee injuries cause inflammation in the bursae, the small sacs of fluid that cushion the outside of your knee joint so that tendons and ligaments glide smoothly over the joint.\n    Patellar tendinitis. Tendinitis causes irritation and inflammation of one or more tendons \u2014 the thick, fibrous tissues that attach muscles to bones. This inflammation can happen when there's an injury to the patellar tendon, which runs from the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone and allows you to kick, run and jump. Runners, skiers, cyclists, and those involved in jumping sports and activities may develop patellar tendinitis.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Mechanical problemsSome examples of mechanical problems that can cause knee pain include:\n\n    Loose body. Sometimes injury or degeneration of bone or cartilage can cause a piece of bone or cartilage to break off and float in the joint space. This may not create any problems unless the loose body interferes with knee joint movement, in which case the effect is something like a pencil caught in a door hinge.\n    Iliotibial band syndrome. This occurs when the tough band of tissue that extends from the outside of your hip to the outside of your knee (iliotibial band) becomes so tight that it rubs against the outer portion of your thighbone. Distance runners and cyclists are especially susceptible to iliotibial band syndrome.\n    Dislocated kneecap. This occurs when the triangular bone that covers the front of your knee (patella) slips out of place, usually to the outside of your knee. In some cases, the kneecap may stay displaced and you'll be able to see the dislocation.\n    Hip or foot pain. If you have hip or foot pain, you may change the way you walk to spare your painful joint. But this altered gait can place more stress on your knee joint and cause knee pain.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Types of arthritisMore than 100 different types of arthritis exist. The varieties most likely to affect the knee include:\n\n    Osteoarthritis. Sometimes called degenerative arthritis, osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It's a wear-and-tear condition that occurs when the cartilage in your knee deteriorates with use and age.\n    Rheumatoid arthritis. The most debilitating form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that can affect almost any joint in your body, including your knees. Although rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease, it tends to vary in severity and may even come and go.\n    Gout. This type of arthritis occurs when uric acid crystals build up in the joint. While gout most commonly affects the big toe, it can also occur in the knee.\n    Pseudogout. Often mistaken for gout, pseudogout is caused by calcium-containing crystals that develop in the joint fluid. Knees are the most common joint affected by pseudogout.\n    Septic arthritis. Sometimes your knee joint can become infected, leading to swelling, pain and redness. Septic arthritis often occurs with a fever, and there's usually no trauma before the onset of pain. Septic arthritis can quickly cause extensive damage to the knee cartilage. If you have knee pain with any of the symptoms of septic arthritis, see your doctor right away.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Other problemsPatellofemoral pain syndrome is a general term that refers to pain arising between the kneecap and the underlying thighbone. It's common in athletes; in young adults, especially those whose kneecap doesn't track properly in its groove; and in older adults, who usually develop the condition as a result of arthritis of the kneecap.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During the physical exam, your doctor is likely to:\n\n    Inspect your knee for swelling, pain, tenderness, warmth and visible bruising\n    Check to see how far you can move your lower leg in different directions\n    Push on or pull the joint to evaluate the integrity of the structures in your knee\n\n        \n            \n            Imaging testsIn some cases, your doctor might suggest tests such as:\n\n    X-ray. Your doctor may first recommend having an X-ray, which can help detect bone fractures and degenerative joint disease.\n    Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scanners combine X-rays taken from many different angles to create cross-sectional images of the inside of your body. CT scans can help diagnose bone problems and subtle fractures. A special kind of CT scan can accurately identify gout even when the joint is not inflamed.\n    Ultrasound. This technology uses sound waves to produce real-time images of the soft tissue structures within and around your knee. Your doctor may want to move your knee into different positions during the ultrasound to check for specific problems.\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses radio waves and a powerful magnet to create 3D images of the inside of your knee. This test is particularly useful in revealing injuries to soft tissues such as ligaments, tendons, cartilage and muscles.\n\n        \n            \n            Lab testsIf your doctor suspects an infection or inflammation, you're likely to have blood tests and sometimes a procedure called arthrocentesis, in which a small amount of fluid is removed from within your knee joint with a needle and sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatments will vary, depending upon what exactly is causing your knee pain.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsYour doctor may prescribe medications to help relieve pain and to treat the conditions causing your knee pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout.\n        \n            \n            TherapyStrengthening the muscles around your knee will make it more stable. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy or different types of strengthening exercises based on the specific condition that is causing your pain.\nIf you are physically active or practice a sport, you may need exercises to correct movement patterns that may be affecting your knees and to establish good technique during your sport or activity. Exercises to improve your flexibility and balance also are important.\nArch supports, sometimes with wedges on one side of the heel, can help shift pressure away from the side of the knee most affected by osteoarthritis. In certain conditions, different types of braces may be used to help protect and support the knee joint.\n        \n            \n            InjectionsIn some cases, your doctor may suggest injecting medications or other substances directly into your joint. Examples include:\n\n    Corticosteroids. Injections of a corticosteroid drug into your knee joint may help reduce the symptoms of an arthritis flare and provide pain relief that may last a few months. These injections aren't effective in all cases.\n    Hyaluronic acid. A thick fluid, similar to the fluid that naturally lubricates joints, hyaluronic acid can be injected into your knee to improve mobility and ease pain. Although study results have been mixed about the effectiveness of this treatment, relief from one or a series of shots may last as long as six months.\n    Platelet-rich plasma (PRP). PRP contains a concentration of many different growth factors that appear to reduce inflammation and promote healing. Some studies have found that PRP may benefit certain people with osteoarthritis, but more studies are needed.\n\n        \n            \n            SurgeryIf you have an injury that may require surgery, it's usually not necessary to have the operation immediately. Before making a decision, consider the pros and cons of both nonsurgical rehabilitation and surgical reconstruction in relation to what's most important to you. If you choose to have surgery, your options may include:\n\n    Arthroscopic surgery. Depending on your injury, your doctor may be able to examine and repair your joint damage using a fiber-optic camera and long, narrow tools inserted through just a few small incisions around your knee. Arthroscopy may be used to remove loose bodies from your knee joint, remove or repair damaged cartilage (especially if it is causing your knee to lock), and reconstruct torn ligaments.\n    Partial knee replacement surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon replaces only the most damaged portion of your knee with parts made of metal and plastic. The surgery can usually be performed through small incisions, so you're likely to heal more quickly than you are with surgery to replace your entire knee.\n    Total knee replacement. In this procedure, your surgeon cuts away damaged bone and cartilage from your thighbone, shinbone and kneecap, and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal alloys, high-grade plastics and polymers.\n    Osteotomy. This procedure involves removing bone from the thighbone or shinbone to better align the knee and relieve arthritis pain. This surgery may help you delay or avoid total knee replacement surgery.\n\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

The errors tell the cell to continue multiplying rapidly.\nBecause cancer cells don't mature and then die as normal cells do, they accumulate, eventually overwhelming production of healthy cells. In the bone marrow \u2014 the soft, blood-producing tissue that fills in the center of most of your bones \u2014 Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells crowd out healthy blood cells.\nWaldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells continue trying to produce antibodies, as healthy white blood cells do, but instead they produce abnormal proteins that the body can't use. The protein immunoglobulin M (IgM) accumulates in the blood, impairs circulation and causes complications.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Tests and procedures used to diagnose Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia include:\n\n    \n    Blood tests. Blood tests may reveal low numbers of healthy blood cells. Also, blood tests are used to detect the IgM proteins produced by the cancer cells.\n    Blood tests may also measure your organ function, which can tell your doctor whether the IgM proteins are affecting your organs, such as your kidneys and your liver.\n    \n    Collecting a sample of bone marrow for testing. During a bone marrow biopsy, your doctor uses a needle to extract some of your bone marrow from your hipbone. The sample is examined to look for cancer cells. If any are detected, advanced laboratory analysis can help your doctor understand the cancer cells' characteristics, including their genetic mutations.\n    Imaging tests. Imaging tests can help your doctor determine whether cancer has spread to other areas of your body. Imaging tests may include computerized tomography (CT) scans or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

Your doctor may recommend blood tests every few months to monitor your condition. You may go years without needing further treatment.\n    Plasma exchange. If you experience signs and symptoms related to having too many IgM proteins in your blood, your doctor may recommend plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) to remove the proteins and replace them with healthy blood plasma.\n    \n    Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that kills quickly growing cells, such as the abnormal blood cells produced by Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.\n    Chemotherapy may be used alone or combined with other drug treatments as an initial treatment for people who experience signs and symptoms of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. High-dose chemotherapy may also be used to suppress your bone marrow production in preparation for a bone marrow transplant.\n    \n    Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy drugs kill cancer cells by focusing on the specific abnormalities present in the cancer cells that allow them to survive. Targeted therapy drugs may be used alone or combined with other medications, such as chemotherapy or biological therapy, as an initial treatment for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or in cases where the cancer returns despite treatment.\n    Biological therapy. Biological therapy drugs use your immune system to kill cancer cells. Biological therapy drugs can be used alone or in combination with other medications as an initial treatment or as a treatment for recurrent Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.\n    Bone marrow transplant. In certain highly selected situations, a bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used to treat Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. During this procedure, high doses of chemotherapy are used to wipe out your diseased bone marrow. Healthy blood stem cells are infused into your body where they can rebuild healthy bone marrow.\n    Clinical trials.

Experienced doctors will select the best biopsy technique to ensure proper surgical treatment and planning. Options include:\n\n    Core needle biopsy. Tiny tubes of tumor material can be obtained by this method. Doctors typically try to take samples from several sections of the tumor.\n    Surgical biopsy. In some cases, your doctor might suggest surgery to obtain a larger sample of tissue or to simply remove a small tumor entirely.\n\nIn the lab, a doctor trained in analyzing body tissues (pathologist) examines the tissue sample for signs of cancer.

When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created.\n\nHow likely you are to develop osteoporosis depends partly on how much bone mass you attained in your youth. Peak bone mass is somewhat inherited and varies also by ethnic group. The higher your peak bone mass, the more bone you have \"in the bank\" and the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis as you age.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your bone density can be measured by a machine that uses low levels of X-rays to determine the proportion of mineral in your bones.

Examples include:\n\n\nAlendronate (Binosto, Fosamax)\nRisedronate (Actonel, Atelvia)\nIbandronate (Boniva)\nZoledronic acid (Reclast, Zometa)\n\n\nSide effects include nausea, abdominal pain and heartburn-like symptoms. These are less likely to occur if the medicine is taken properly.\n\nIntravenous forms of bisphosphonates don't cause stomach upset but can cause fever, headache and muscle aches for up to three days. It might be easier to schedule a quarterly or yearly injection than to remember to take a weekly or monthly pill, but it can be more costly to do so.\n\n        \n            \n            Monoclonal antibody medicationsCompared with bisphosphonates, denosumab (Prolia, Xgeva) produces similar or better bone density results and reduces the chance of all types of fractures. Denosumab is delivered via a shot under the skin every six months.\n\nIf you take denosumab, you might have to continue to do so indefinitely. Recent research indicates there could be a high risk of spinal column fractures after stopping the drug.\n\nA very rare complication of bisphosphonates and denosumab is a break or crack in the middle of the thighbone.\n\nA second rare complication is delayed healing of the jawbone (osteonecrosis of the jaw). This can occur after an invasive dental procedure such as removing a tooth.\n\nYou should have a dental examination before starting these medications, and you should continue to take good care of your teeth and see your dentist regularly while on them. Make sure your dentist knows that you're taking these medications. \n\n        \n            \n            Hormone-related therapyEstrogen, especially when started soon after menopause, can help maintain bone density. However, estrogen therapy can increase the risk of blood clots, endometrial cancer, breast cancer and possibly heart disease. Therefore, estrogen is typically used for bone health in younger women or in women whose menopausal symptoms also require treatment.\n\nRaloxifene (Evista) mimics estrogen's beneficial effects on bone density in postmenopausal women, without some of the risks associated with estrogen. Taking this drug can reduce the risk of some types of breast cancer. Hot flashes are a common side effect. Raloxifene also may increase your risk of blood clots.\n\nIn men, osteoporosis might be linked with a gradual age-related decline in testosterone levels. Testosterone replacement therapy can help improve symptoms of low testosterone, but osteoporosis medications have been better studied in men to treat osteoporosis and thus are recommended alone or in addition to testosterone. \n\n        \n            \n            Bone-building medicationsIf you can't tolerate the more common treatments for osteoporosis \u2014 or if they don't work well enough \u2014 your doctor might suggest trying:\n\n    Teriparatide (Forteo). This powerful drug is similar to parathyroid hormone and stimulates new bone growth. It's given by daily injection under the skin. After two years of treatment with teriparatide, another osteoporosis drug is taken to maintain the new bone growth.\n    Abaloparatide (Tymlos) is another drug similar to parathyroid hormone. You can take it for only two years, which will be followed by another osteoporosis medication.\n    Romosozumab (Evenity). This is the newest bone-building medication to treat osteoporosis. It is given as an injection every month at your doctor's office.

A tonometry exam measures the pressure inside your eye (intraocular pressure). Numbing eyedrops may be used for this test.\n    A slit-lamp examination. A slit lamp is a microscope that magnifies and illuminates the front of your eye with an intense line of light. This evaluation is necessary to identify microscopic inflammatory cells in the front of the eye.\n    Ophthalmoscopy.

This test measures the thickness of the retina and choroid to reveal inflammation in these layers.\n    Fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography. These tests require placement of an intravenous (IV) catheter in a vein in your arm in order to administer a dye. This dye will reach the blood vessels in the eyes and allow photographs of blood vessel inflammation inside the eyes.\n    Analysis of aqueous or vitreous fluid from the eye.\n    Blood tests.\n    Imaging tests, radiography, CT or MRI scans.\n\nIf the ophthalmologist thinks an underlying condition may be the cause of your uveitis, you may be referred to another doctor for a general medical examination and laboratory tests.\nSometimes, it's difficult to find a specific cause for uveitis. Even if a specific cause is not identified, uveitis can still be treated successfully. In the majority of cases, identifying a cause for the uveitis does not lead to a cure.

Usually the treatment for uveitis is the same regardless of the associated cause, as long as it is not infectious. The goal of treatment is to reduce the inflammation in your eye, as well as in other parts of the body, if present. In some cases, treatment may be necessary for months to years. Several treatment options are available.\n        \n            \n            Medications\n    Drugs that reduce inflammation. Your doctor may first prescribe eyedrops with an anti-inflammatory medication, such as a corticosteroid. Eyedrops are usually not enough to treat inflammation beyond the front of the eye, so a corticosteroid injection in or around the eye or corticosteroid tablets (taken by mouth) may be necessary.\n    Drugs that control spasms. Eyedrops that widen (dilate) the pupil may be prescribed to control spasms in the iris and ciliary body, which can help relieve eye pain.\n    Drugs that fight bacteria or viruses. If uveitis is caused by an infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, antiviral medications or other medicines, with or without corticosteroids, to bring the infection under control.\n    Drugs that affect the immune system or destroy cells. You may need immunosuppressive drugs if your uveitis affects both eyes, doesn't respond well to corticosteroids or becomes severe enough to threaten your vision.\n\nSome of these medications can have serious eye-related side effects, such as glaucoma and cataracts. Medications by mouth or injection can have side effects in other parts of the body outside the eyes. You may need to visit your doctor for follow-up examinations and blood tests every one to three months.\n        \n            \n            Surgical or other procedures\n    Vitrectomy. Surgery to remove some of the vitreous in your eye is rarely used to diagnose or manage the condition.\n    \n    A medication-releasing implant. For people with difficult-to-treat posterior uveitis, a device that's implanted in the eye may be an option. This device slowly releases corticosteroid into the eye for two to three years.\n    Cataracts usually develop in people who have not yet had cataract surgery. Up to 30% of patients will also require treatment for elevated eye pressure to prevent the development of glaucoma.\n    \n\nThe speed of your recovery depends in part on the type of uveitis you have and the severity of your symptoms. Uveitis that affects the back of your eye (posterior uveitis or panuveitis, including retinitis or choroiditis) tends to heal more slowly than uveitis in the front of the eye (anterior uveitis or iritis).

The amount of bleeding varies from one person to another, depending on the type and severity of the disease.\nIf you have von Willebrand disease, you might have:\n\n    Excessive bleeding from an injury or after surgery or dental work\n    Nosebleeds that don't stop within 10 minutes\n    Heavy or long menstrual bleeding\n    Blood in your urine or stool\n    Easy bruising or lumpy bruises\n\nMenstrual signs and symptoms may include:\n\n    Blood clots greater than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter in your menstrual flow\n    The need to change your menstrual pad or tampon more than once an hour\n    The need to use double sanitary protection for menstrual flow\n    Symptoms of anemia, including tiredness, fatigue or shortness of breath\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorContact your doctor if you have bleeding that lasts a long time or is hard to stop.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The usual cause of von Willebrand disease is an inherited abnormal gene that controls von Willebrand factor \u2014 a protein that plays a key role in blood clotting.\nWhen you have low levels of this protein or it doesn't work as it should, small blood cells called platelets cannot stick together properly nor attach themselves normally to the blood vessel walls when an injury has occurred. This interferes with the clotting process and can sometimes cause uncontrolled bleeding.\nMany people with von Willebrand disease also have low levels of factor VIII, another protein that helps in clotting.\nFactor VIII is involved in another inherited clotting disorder called hemophilia. But unlike hemophilia, which mainly affects males, von Willebrand disease affects males and females and is usually milder.\nRarely, von Willebrand disease can develop later in life in people who didn't inherit an abnormal gene from a parent. This is known as acquired von Willebrand syndrome, and it's likely caused by an underlying medical condition.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Mild forms of von Willebrand disease can be difficult to diagnose because bleeding is common, and, for most people, doesn't indicate a disease. However, if your doctor suspects you have a bleeding disorder, he or she might refer you to a blood disorders specialist (hematologist).\nTo evaluate you for von Willebrand disease, your doctor will likely ask you detailed questions about your medical history and check for bruises or other signs of recent bleeding.\nYour doctor will also likely recommend the following blood tests:\n\n    Von Willebrand factor antigen. This determines the level of von Willebrand factor in your blood by measuring a particular protein.\n    Von Willebrand factor activity. There are a variety of tests to measure how well the von Willebrand factor works in your clotting process.\n    Factor VIII clotting activity. This shows whether you have abnormally low levels and activity of factor VIII.\n    Von Willebrand factor multimers. This evaluates the structure of von Willebrand factor in your blood, its protein complexes and how its molecules break down. This information helps identify the type of von Willebrand disease you have.\n\nThe results of these tests can fluctuate in the same person over time due to factors such as stress, exercise, infection, pregnancy and medications. So you might need to repeat some tests.\nIf you have von Willebrand disease, your doctor might suggest that family members undergo tests to determine if this condition runs in your family.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Even though von Willebrand disease has no cure, treatment can help prevent or stop bleeding episodes. Your treatment depends on:\n\n    The type and severity of your condition\n    How you've responded to previous therapy\n    Your other medications and conditions\n\nYour doctor might suggest one or more of the following treatments to increase your von Willebrand factor, strengthen blood clots or, in women, control heavy menstrual bleeding:\n\n    \n    Desmopressin. This medication is available as an injection (DDAVP) or nasal spray (Minirin) It's a synthetic hormone that controls bleeding by stimulating your body to release more of the von Willebrand factor stored in the lining of your blood vessels.\n    Many doctors consider DDAVP the first treatment for managing von Willebrand disease. Some women use the nasal spray at the beginning of their menstrual periods to control excessive bleeding. It can also be effective when used before a minor surgical procedure.\n    \n    Replacement therapies. These include infusions of concentrated blood-clotting factors containing von Willebrand factor and factor VIII. Your doctor might recommend them if DDAVP isn't an option for you or was ineffective.\n    Another replacement therapy approved by the FDA for treating adults 18 and older is a genetically engineered (recombinant) von Willebrand factor product. Because recombinant factor is made without plasma, it can reduce the risk of a viral infection or allergic reaction.\n    \n    Oral contraceptives. For women, these can be useful for controlling heavy bleeding during menstrual periods. The estrogen hormones in birth control pills can boost von Willebrand factor and factor VIII activity. This effect is likely available with birth control patches, though further study is needed to confirm it.\n    Clot-stabilizing medications. These anti-fibrinolytic medications \u2014 such as aminocaproic acid (Amicar) and tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron, Lysteda) \u2014 can help stop bleeding by slowing the breakdown of blood clots. Doctors often prescribe these drugs before or after a surgical procedure or tooth extraction.\n    Drugs applied to cuts. A fibrin sealant (Tisseel VHSD) placed on a cut helps curtail bleeding. This is applied like glue using a syringe. There are also over-the-counter products to stop nosebleeds.\n\nIf your condition is mild, your doctor might recommend treatment only when you're having surgery or dental work or when you've had a trauma, such as a car accident.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

He or she can assess your skin and help you create a personalized skin care plan. A dermatologist can also recommend medical wrinkle treatments.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Wrinkles are caused by a combination of factors \u2014 some you can control, others you can't:\n\n    \n    Age. As you get older, your skin naturally becomes less elastic and more fragile. Decreased production of natural oils dries your skin and makes it appear more wrinkled.\n    Fat in the deeper layers of your skin diminishes. This causes loose, saggy skin and more-pronounced lines and crevices.\n    \n    \n    Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. Ultraviolet radiation, which speeds the natural aging process, is the primary cause of early wrinkling. Exposure to UV light breaks down your skin's connective tissue \u2014 collagen and elastin fibers, which lie in the deeper layer of skin (dermis).\n    Without the supportive connective tissue, your skin loses strength and flexibility. Skin then begins to sag and wrinkle prematurely.\n    \n    Smoking. Smoking can accelerate the normal aging process of your skin, contributing to wrinkles. This may be due to smoking's effect on collagen.\n    Repeated facial expressions. Facial movements and expressions, such as squinting or smiling, lead to fine lines and wrinkles. Each time you use a facial muscle, a groove forms beneath the surface of the skin. And as skin ages, it loses its flexibility and is no longer able to spring back in place. These grooves then become permanent features on your face.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "", "Treatment": "Several wrinkle treatment options are available to help smooth wrinkles or make them less noticeable.\n        \n            \n            Medications\n    \n    Topical retinoids. Prescription medicine that contains retinoids, which is derived from vitamin A, may reduce fine wrinkles, splotches and roughness when applied to the skin. You may need to use the product for a few weeks or months before you notice improvement. Products include tretinoin (Renova, Retin-A) and tazarotene (Avage, Tazorac), and a synthetic version called adapalene is also an option. Retinoids might cause temporary itching, redness, burning or dryness.\n    Because retinoids can make your skin burn more easily, you'll need to daily use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 and wear protective clothing.\n    \n    \n    Nonprescription wrinkle creams. The effectiveness of anti-wrinkle creams depends in part on the active ingredients. Retinol, antioxidants and some peptides may result in slight to modest improvements in wrinkles.\n    With nonprescription wrinkle creams, your results, if any, are limited and usually short-lived because these creams contain less of the active ingredients than do prescription creams.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Surgical procedures and other techniquesA variety of procedures are used to smooth out wrinkles. Some studies indicate that a combination of treatments may yield the most satisfying results. Talk with your doctor about what's important to you and which approach would best meet your needs and expectations as far as recovery time and results.\n\n    \n    Laser resurfacing. In ablative (wounding) laser resurfacing, a laser beam destroys the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and heats the underlying skin (dermis). This stimulates the growth of new collagen fibers. As the wound heals, smoother, tighter skin forms. Laser resurfacing can't eliminate excessive or sagging skin.\n    Laser resurfacing may be done as an outpatient procedure, usually with a local anesthetic. You may be fully sedated for extensive resurfacing. It can take several months to fully heal from ablative laser resurfacing. A newer method using fractional lasers has a shorter recovery time. Risks include scarring and lightening or darkening of skin color.\n    A technique called nonablative laser fractional resurfacing has a shorter healing time and fewer risks than does the ablative technique. Nonablative lasers are better suited to people with moderate wrinkles because results are subtle. This treatment needs to be repeated more often than does ablative treatment. This method also can be done with a fractional laser.\n    \n    Photodynamic rejuvenation. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can treat fine wrinkles caused by sun exposure. You may need repeat treatments, but recovery for PDT is shorter than it is with laser resurfacing.\n    Chemical peel. Your doctor applies a chemical solution to the skin to remove the top layers. The skin that grows back after a chemical peel is smother. Depending on the depth of the peel, you may need several treatments before you see a difference in your skin. Redness lasts up to several weeks. Possible side effects include scarring, infection, and lightening or darkening of skin color.\n    \n    Dermabrasion. Dermabrasion sands down the surface layer of skin with a rapidly rotating brush. New skin grows in its place. You may need to undergo the procedure more than once.\n    Possible side effects include temporary redness, scabbing and swelling. It may take several months for pinkness to fade and for you to see results.\n    \n    \n    Microdermabrasion. Similar to dermabrasion, this technique removes only a fine layer of skin. You'll need a series of treatments over months to produce modest, temporary results. If you have rosacea or tiny red veins on your face, this technique could make the condition worse.\n    You may notice a slight redness or stinging sensation on the treated areas.\n    \n    \n    Botulinum toxin type A (Botox). When injected in small doses into specific muscles, Botox keeps the muscles from contracting. When the muscles can't tighten, the skin appears smoother and less wrinkled.\n    Botox works well on frown lines between the eyebrows and across the forehead and on crow's-feet at the eye corners. It takes one to three days to see results. The effect typically lasts a few months. Repeat injections are needed to maintain results.\n    \n    Soft tissue fillers. Soft tissue fillers, which include fat, collagen and hyaluronic acid (Restylane, Juvederm, others), can be injected into wrinkles on your face. They plump and smooth wrinkles and furrows. You may experience temporary swelling, redness and bruising in the treated area. The effect of most products is temporary.\n    \n    Face-lift. The face-lift procedure involves tightening the underlying muscle and tissues. It may be done in a hospital or an outpatient surgical facility, with a local anesthetic, sedation or general anesthesia. Healing times can be lengthy after a face-lift. Bruising and swelling are usually evident for several weeks after surgery.\n    Face-lift results are not permanent. You may choose to undergo another face-lift several years later.\n    \n\nKeep in mind that results vary depending on the location and depth of your wrinkles. Nothing stops the aging process of skin, so you'll likely need repeated treatments to maintain benefits.\nThese procedures aren't usually covered by insurance. Also, any of the procedures can have side effects, so be sure to discuss them with your doctor. Make sure your dermatologist or plastic surgeon is specially trained and experienced in the technique you're considering.More InformationWrinkles care at Mayo ClinicWrinkle creamsBotox injectionsChemical peelDermabrasionFace-liftFacial fillers for wrinklesLaser resurfacingNeck liftShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

But the sequence of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is clear. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors (gastrinomas) form in your pancreas or duodenum or at other sites such as the lymph nodes adjacent to your pancreas.\nYour pancreas sits behind and below your stomach. It produces enzymes that are essential to digesting food. The pancreas also produces several hormones including insulin, a hormone that helps to control your blood glucose.\nDigestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum, the part of the small intestine next to your stomach. This is where digestion reaches its peak.\nThe tumors that occur with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are made up of cells that secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Increased gastrin makes the stomach produce far too much acid. The excess acid then leads to peptic ulcers and sometimes to diarrhea.\nBesides causing excess acid production, the tumors are often cancerous (malignant). Although the tumors tend to grow slowly, the cancer can spread elsewhere \u2014 most commonly to nearby lymph nodes or your liver.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Association with MEN 1Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may be caused by an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1). People with MEN 1 also have tumors in the parathyroid glands and may have tumors in their pituitary glands.\nAbout 25% of people who have gastrinomas have them as part of Men 1. They may also have tumors in the pancreas and other organs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will base a diagnosis on the following:\n\n    Medical history. Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and review your medical history.\n    \n    Blood tests. A sample of your blood is analyzed to see whether you have elevated gastrin levels. While elevated gastrin may indicate tumors in your pancreas or duodenum, it can also be caused by other conditions. For example, gastrin may also be elevated if your stomach isn't making acid, or you're taking acid-reducing medications, such as proton pump inhibitors.\n    You need to fast before this test and may need to stop taking any acid-reducing medications to get the most accurate measure of your gastrin levels. Because gastrin levels can fluctuate, this test may be repeated a few times.\n    Your doctor may also perform a secretin stimulation test. For this test, your doctor first measures your gastrin levels, then gives you an injection of the hormone secretin and measures gastrin levels again. If you have Zollinger-Ellison, your gastrin levels will increase even more.\n    \n    Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. After you're sedated, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible instrument with a light and video camera (endoscope) down your throat and into your stomach and duodenum to look for ulcers. Through the endoscope, your doctor may remove a tissue sample (biopsy) from your duodenum to help detect the presence of gastrin-producing tumors. Your doctor will ask you not to eat anything after midnight the night before the test.\n    \n    Endoscopic ultrasound. In this procedure, your doctor examines your stomach, duodenum and pancreas with an endoscope fitted with an ultrasound probe. The probe allows for closer inspection, making it easier to spot tumors.\n    It's also possible to remove a tissue sample through the endoscope. You'll need to fast after midnight the night before this test, and you'll be sedated during the test.\n    \n    Imaging tests. Your doctor may use imaging techniques such as a nuclear scan called somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. This test uses radioactive tracers to help locate tumors. Other helpful imaging tests include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT scanning.\nMore InformationCT scanEndoscopic ultrasoundMRIUltrasoundShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome addresses the hormone-secreting tumors as well as the ulcers they cause.\n        \n            \n            Treatment of tumorsAn operation to remove the tumors that occur in Zollinger-Ellison requires a skilled surgeon because the tumors are often small and difficult to locate. If you have just one tumor, your doctor may be able to remove it surgically, but surgery may not be an option if you have multiple tumors or tumors that have spread to your liver. On the other hand, even if you have multiple tumors, your doctor still may recommend removing a single large tumor.\nIn some cases, doctors advise other treatments to control tumor growth, including:\n\n    Removing as much of a liver tumor as possible (debulking)\n    Attempting to destroy the tumor by cutting off the blood supply (embolization) or by using heat to destroy cancer cells (radiofrequency ablation)\n    Injecting drugs into the tumor to relieve cancer symptoms\n    Using chemotherapy to try to slow tumor growth\n    Having a liver transplant\n\n        \n            \n            Treatment of excess acidExcess acid production can almost always be controlled. Medications known as proton pump inhibitors are the first line of treatment. These are effective medications for decreasing acid production in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\nProton pump inhibitors are powerful drugs that reduce acid by blocking the action of the tiny \"pumps\" within acid-secreting cells. Commonly prescribed medications include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and esomeprazole (Nexium).\nLong-term use of prescription proton pump inhibitors, especially in people age 50 and older, has been associated with an increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist and spine, according to the Food and Drug Administration. This risk is small and should be weighed against the acid-blocking benefits of these medications.\nOctreotide (Sandostatin), a medication similar to the hormone somatostatin, may counteract the effects of gastrin and be helpful for some people.More InformationChemotherapyLiver transplantRadiofrequency ablation for cancer\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Doctors often don't know the cause of vocal cord paralysis. Known causes may include:\n\n    Injury to the vocal cord during surgery. Surgery on or near your neck or upper chest can result in damage to the nerves that serve your voice box. Surgeries that carry a risk of damage include surgeries to the thyroid or parathyroid glands, esophagus, neck, and chest.\n    Neck or chest injury. Trauma to your neck or chest may injure the nerves that serve your vocal cords or the voice box itself.\n    Stroke. A stroke interrupts blood flow in your brain and may damage the part of your brain that sends messages to the voice box.\n    Tumors. Tumors, both cancerous and noncancerous, can grow in or around the muscles, cartilage or nerves controlling the function of your voice box and can cause vocal cord paralysis.\n    Infections. Some infections, such as Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr virus and herpes, can cause inflammation and directly damage the nerves in the larynx.\n    Neurological conditions. If you have certain neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, you may experience vocal cord paralysis.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and lifestyle, listen to your voice, and ask you how long you've had voice problems. To further evaluate your voice problems, the following tests may be performed:\n\n    \n    Laryngoscopy. Your doctor will look at your vocal cords using a mirror or a thin, flexible tube (known as a laryngoscope or endoscope) or both. You may also have a test called videostrobolaryngoscopy that's done using a special scope that contains a tiny camera at its tip or a larger camera connected to the scope's viewing piece.\n    These special high-magnification endoscopes allow your doctor to view your vocal cords directly or on a video monitor to determine the movement and position of the vocal cords and whether one or both vocal cords are affected.\n    \n    \n    Laryngeal electromyography. This test measures the electric currents in your voice box muscles. To obtain these measurements, your doctor typically inserts small needles into your vocal cord muscles through the skin of the neck.\n    This test doesn't usually provide information that might change the course of treatment, but it may give your doctor information about how well you may recover. This test is most useful for predicting how you'll recover when it's done between six weeks and six months after your symptoms began.\n    \n    Blood tests and scans.

Treatment may include voice therapy, bulk injections, surgery or a combination of treatments.\nIn some instances, you may get better without surgical treatment. For this reason, your doctor may delay permanent surgery for at least a year from the beginning of your vocal cord paralysis.\nHowever, surgical treatment with bulk injections containing collagen-like substances is often done within the first 3 months of voice loss.\nDuring the waiting period for surgery, your doctor may suggest voice therapy to help keep you from using your voice improperly while the nerves heal.\n\n        \n            \n            Voice therapyVoice therapy sessions involve exercises or other activities to strengthen your vocal cords, improve breath control during speech, prevent abnormal tension in other muscles around the paralyzed vocal cord or cords and protect your airway during swallowing. Occasionally, voice therapy may be the only treatment you need if your vocal cords were paralyzed in a location that doesn't require additional bulk or repositioning.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryIf your vocal cord paralysis symptoms don't fully recover on their own, surgical treatments may be offered to improve your ability to speak and to swallow.\nSurgical options include:\n\n    Bulk injection. Paralysis of the nerve to your vocal cord will probably leave the vocal cord muscle thin and weak. To add bulk to a paralyzed vocal cord, a doctor who specializes in disorders of the larynx (laryngologist) may inject your vocal cord with a substance such as body fat, collagen or another approved filler substance. This added bulk brings the affected vocal cord closer to the middle of your voice box so that the opposite functioning and moving vocal cord can make closer contact with the paralyzed cord when you speak, swallow or cough.\n    Structural implants. Instead of using a bulk injection, this procedure \u2014 known as thyroplasty, medialization laryngoplasty or laryngeal framework surgery \u2014 relies on the use of an implant in the larynx to reposition the vocal cord. Rarely, people who have this surgery may need to have a second surgery to reposition the implant.\n    Vocal cord repositioning. In this procedure, a surgeon moves a window of your own tissue from the outside of your voice box inward, pushing the paralyzed vocal cord toward the middle of your voice box. This allows your unimpaired vocal cord to better vibrate against its paralyzed partner.\n    Replacing the damaged nerve (reinnervation). In this surgery, a healthy nerve is moved from a different area of the neck to replace the damaged vocal cord. It can take as long as six to nine months before the voice improves. Some doctors combine this surgery with a bulk injection.\n    \n    Tracheotomy. If both of your vocal cords are paralyzed and positioned closely together, your airflow will be decreased. In this situation, you'll have a lot of trouble breathing and require a surgical procedure called a tracheotomy.\n    In a tracheotomy, an incision is made in the front of your neck and an opening created directly into the windpipe (trachea). A breathing tube is inserted, allowing air to bypass the immobilized vocal cords.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Emerging treatmentsLinking the vocal cords to an alternative source of electrical stimulation \u2014 perhaps a nerve from another part of the body or a device similar to a cardiac pacemaker \u2014 may restore opening and closing of the vocal cords.

Experts suspect that defective genes play a role. But it's usually not known whether such genetic defects are inherited or simply develop over time. Or, they might be caused by something in the environment, such as exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nMost vertebral tumors are metastatic, which means they have spread from tumors in organs elsewhere in the body. Any type of cancer can travel to the spine, but common tumor spread from the breast, lung and prostate are more likely than others to spread to the spine. Cancers of the bone, such as multiple myeloma, also may spread to the spine.\n \nVertebral tumors are also more common in people who have a prior history of cancer. \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Vertebral tumors sometimes may be overlooked because their symptoms resemble those of more-common conditions. For that reason, it's especially important that your doctor know your complete medical history and perform both general physical and neurological exams.\t\n\n    \n    Spinal tumor consultation\n    \n\n\n\n        \n            \n            If your doctor suspects a vertebral tumor, one or more of the following tests can help confirm the diagnosis and pinpoint the tumor's location:\n\n\nSpinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to produce accurate images of your spine, spinal cord and nerves. MRI is usually the preferred test to diagnose vertebral tumors. A contrast agent that helps to highlight certain tissues and structures may be injected into a vein in your hand or forearm during the test.\n\nSome people may feel claustrophobic inside the MRI scanner or find the loud thumping sound it makes disturbing. Earplugs, televisions or headphones can be used to help minimize the noise. Mild sedatives are frequently used to relieve the anxiety of claustrophobia.\n\n\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan. This test uses a narrow beam of radiation to produce detailed images of your spine. Sometimes it may be combined with an injected contrast dye to make abnormal changes in the spinal canal or spinal cord easier to see. CT scan may be used in combination with MRI.\nBiopsy. Often, the only way to determine the type of tumor is to examine a small tissue sample (biopsy) under a microscope. The biopsy results will help determine treatment options.\nThe method used to obtain the biopsy sample can be critical to the success of the overall treatment plan. You should thoroughly discuss the biopsy with your doctor as well as your surgical team to prevent potential complications. In most cases, a radiologist will conduct a fine-needle biopsy to extract a small amount of tissue, usually under the guidance of X-ray or CT imaging.\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n    \n    MRI scan\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your vertebral tumor-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationVertebral tumor care at Mayo ClinicCT scanMRINeedle biopsyShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Surgical vertebral tumor removal and reconstruction\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSurgical vertebral tumor removal and reconstruction\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSurgical vertebral tumor removal and reconstruction\n\t\t\t\tUsing microsurgical techniques, a tumor is gently teased out of the spinal cord in the cervical spine.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, the goal of vertebral tumor treatment is to completely get rid of the tumor. But, this might be complicated by the risk of permanent damage to the spinal cord or surrounding nerves. Doctors also must consider your age, overall health, the type of tumor, and whether it is primary or has spread or metastasized to your spine from elsewhere in your body.\n\nTreatment options for most vertebral tumors include:\n\n\nMonitoring. Some tumors may be discovered before they cause symptoms \u2014 often when you're being evaluated for another condition. If small tumors are noncancerous and aren't growing or pressing on surrounding tissues, watching them carefully may be all that's needed.\n\nThis is especially true in older adults for whom surgery or radiation therapy may pose special risks. During observation, your doctor will likely recommend periodic CT or MRI scans at an appropriate interval to monitor the tumor.\n\nSurgery. This is often the treatment of choice for tumors that can be removed with an acceptable risk of spinal cord or nerve injury.\n\nNewer techniques and instruments allow neurosurgeons to reach tumors that were once considered inaccessible.  Sometimes, surgeons may use a high-powered microscope in microsurgery to make it easier to distinguish a tumor from healthy tissue.\n\nDoctors can also monitor the function of the spinal cord and other important nerves during surgery, thus minimizing the chance of their being injured. In some instances, an ultrasound might be used during surgery to break up tumors and remove the fragments.\n\nBut even with advances in surgical techniques and technology, not all tumors can be totally removed. Sometimes, surgery might be followed by radiation therapy, chemotherapy or both.\n\nRecovery from spinal surgery may take weeks or longer, depending on the procedure or complications, such as bleeding and damage to nerve tissue.\n\n\nRadiation therapy. This may be used following an operation to eliminate the remnants of tumors that can't be completely removed, treat inoperable tumors or treat those tumors where surgery is too risky.\n\nIt may also be the first line therapy for some vertebral tumors. Radiation therapy may also be used to relieve pain when surgery is too risky.\n\nMedications may help ease some of the side effects of radiation, such as nausea and vomiting.\n\nSometimes, your radiation therapy regimen may be adjusted to help prevent damage to surrounding tissue from the radiation and improve the treatment's effectiveness. Modifications may range from simply changing the dosage of radiation to using sophisticated techniques such as 3-D conformal radiation therapy.\n\nA specialized type of radiation therapy called proton beam therapy also may be used to treat some vertebral tumors such as chordomas, chondrosarcomas and some childhood cancers when spinal radiation is required. Proton beam therapy can better target radioactive protons at the tumor site without damaging the surrounding tissue as in traditional radiation therapy.\n\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). This treatment, which isn't actually surgery, delivers a high dose of precisely targeted radiation. In SRS, doctors use computers to focus radiation beams on tumors with pinpoint accuracy and from multiple angles.\n\nThere are different types of technology used in radiosurgery to stereotactically deliver radiation to treat vertebral tumors.\n\nSRS has certain limits on the size and specific type of the tumors that can be treated. But when appropriate, it's been proved quite effective. Growing research supports its use for the treatment of spinal tumors.\n\nHowever, there are risks \u2014 such as an increased risk of vertebral fractures. Further study is needed to determine the best technique, radiation dose and schedule for SRS in the treatment of vertebral tumors.\n\n\nChemotherapy. A standard treatment for many types of cancer, chemotherapy uses medications to destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing. Your doctor can determine whether chemotherapy might be beneficial for you, either alone or in combination with other therapies.\n\nSide effects may include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, increased risk of infection and hair loss.\n\nOther drugs. Because surgery and radiation therapy as well as tumors themselves can cause inflammation inside the spinal cord, doctors sometimes prescribe corticosteroids to reduce the swelling, either following surgery or during radiation treatments.\n \nAlthough corticosteroids reduce inflammation, they are usually used only for short periods to avoid serious side effects such as muscle weakness, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, diabetes and an increased susceptibility to infection.\n\n \n\n\n\t\n\n    \n    SRS treatment\n    Stereotactic radiosurgery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

These include:\n\n    Abnormalities of the heart that result in scarring of heart tissue (sometimes called \"structural heart disease\"), the most common cause is a prior heart attack\n    Poor blood flow to the heart muscle due to coronary artery disease\n    Congenital heart conditions, including long QT syndrome\n    Imbalance of electrolytes necessary for conducting electrical impulses\n    Medication side effects\n    Use of drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine\n\nIn some cases, the exact cause of ventricular tachycardia can't be determined (idiopathic ventricular tachycardia).\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            The heart's electrical system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Normal heartbeat\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tNormal heartbeat\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tNormal heartbeat\r\n\t\t\t\tIn a normal heart rhythm, a cluster of cells at the sinus node sends out an electrical signal. The signal then travels through the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node and then passes into the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump out blood.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the causes of heart rate or rhythm problems such as tachycardia, it helps to understand how the heart's electrical system works.\nYour heart is made up of four chambers \u2014 two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Your heartbeat is normally controlled by a natural pacemaker called the sinus node, which is located in the right atrium. The sinus node produces electrical impulses that normally start each heartbeat.\nFrom the sinus node, electrical impulses travel across the atria, causing the atrial muscles to contract and pump blood into the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles).\nThe electrical impulses then arrive at a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node \u2014 usually the only pathway for signals to travel from the atria to the ventricles.\nThe AV node slows down the electrical signal before sending it to the ventricles. This slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood. When electrical impulses reach the muscles of the ventricles, they contract, causing them to pump blood either to the lungs or to the rest of the body.\nWhen anything disrupts this complex system, it can cause the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia) or with an irregular rhythm.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\t\n\n    \n    Ventricular tachycardia consultation at Mayo Clinic\n    A thorough physical exam, medical history and testing are required to diagnose ventricular tachycardia.\n\n\nYour doctor will evaluate your symptoms, perform a physical examination, and ask you about your health habits and medical history.

Your doctor can look for patterns among the signals to determine what kind of tachycardia you have and how problems in the heart may be causing a fast heart rate.\nYour doctor may also ask you to use a portable ECG device at home to obtain more information about your heart rate. These devices include:\n\n    Holter monitor. You carry this portable ECG device in your pocket or wear it on a belt or shoulder strap. It records your heart's activity for an entire 24-hour period, which gives your doctor a prolonged look at your heart rhythms.

The sinus node sends electrical signals that normally start each heartbeat. These electrical signals move across the atria, causing the heart muscles to squeeze (contract) and pump blood into the ventricles.\nNext, the signals arrive at a cluster of cells called the AV node, where they slow down. This slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood. When the electrical signals reach the ventricles, the lower heart chambers contract and pump blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body.\nIn a healthy heart, this heart signaling process usually goes smoothly, resulting in a normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            The heart during ventricular fibrillationVentricular fibrillation is caused by either a problem in the heart's electrical properties or by a disruption of the normal blood supply to the heart muscle. Sometimes, the cause of ventricular fibrillation is unknown.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Ventricular fibrillation is always diagnosed in an emergency situation. A pulse check will reveal no pulse if sudden cardiac death occurred.\nTests to diagnose and determine the cause of ventricular fibrillation include:\n\n    Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and painless test measures the electrical activity of your heart. Sticky patches (electrodes) are placed on your chest and sometimes your arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which displays the test results. An ECG can show if your heart is beating too fast, too slow or not at all. If you're having an episode of ventricular fibrillation, the ECG usually shows a heartbeat of about 300 to 400 beats a minute.\n    Blood tests. Blood tests can be done to check for enzymes that leak into the bloodstream when the heart is damaged by a heart attack.\n    Chest X-ray. An X-ray image of your chest allows your doctor to check the size and shape of your heart and its blood vessels.\n    Echocardiogram. This noninvasive test uses sound waves to produce images of your heart's size, structure and motion.\n    Coronary catheterization (angiogram). To determine if your coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked, a dye is injected through a long, thin tube (catheter) that's inserted through an artery, usually in your groin area, to the heart's arteries. The dye makes your arteries show up more clearly on X-ray, revealing areas of blockage.\n    Cardiac computerized tomography (CT). During a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and creates images of your heart and chest.\n    Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The goal of emergency treatment is to restore blood flow as quickly as possible to prevent organ and brain damage.\nEmergency treatment for ventricular fibrillation includes:\n\n\tCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR mimics the pumping motion of the heart and keeps blood flowing through the body. First call 911 or your local emergency number. Then start CPR by pushing hard and fast on the person's chest \u2014 about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. Let the chest rise completely between compressions. Continue CPR until an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available or emergency personnel arrive.\n\tDefibrillation. This treatment is also called cardioversion. An automated external defibrillator (AED) delivers shocks through the chest wall to the heart. It can help restore a normal heart rhythm. As soon as an AED is available, apply it and follow the prompts. If you're not trained to use an AED, a 911 operator or another emergency medical operator may be able to give you instructions.

The battery-powered device is implanted near your left collarbone during a minor surgery. One or more flexible, insulated wires (leads) from the ICD run through veins to your heart.\n    Cardiac ablation. This procedure uses heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in your heart to block the abnormal electrical signals that cause ventricular fibrillation. It's most often done using thin, flexible tubes called catheters inserted through the veins or arteries. It may also be done during heart surgery.\n    Coronary angioplasty and stent placement. If your ventricular fibrillation was caused by a heart attack, this procedure may reduce your risk of future episodes of ventricular fibrillation.\nDoctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) through an artery, usually in the groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. A balloon on the tip of the catheter briefly inflates to widen the artery, restoring blood flow to the heart. During the procedure, the doctor may place a metal mesh stent into the artery to help it stay open.\n    Coronary bypass surgery. This open-heart surgery improves blood flow to the heart. It may be done if your ventricular fibrillation was caused by coronary artery disease. During bypass surgery, the surgeon takes a healthy blood vessel from your leg, arm or chest and connects it below and above the blocked arteries in your heart.

Arteries carry blood from your heart to the rest of your tissues, and veins return blood from the rest of your body to your heart, so the blood can be recirculated. To return blood to your heart, the veins in your legs must work against gravity.\nMuscle contractions in your lower legs act as pumps, and elastic vein walls help blood return to your heart. Tiny valves in your veins open as blood flows toward your heart then close to stop blood from flowing backward. If these valves are weak or damaged, blood can flow backward and pool in the vein, causing the veins to stretch or twist.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To diagnose varicose veins, your doctor will do a physical exam, including looking at your legs while you're standing to check for swelling. Your doctor may also ask you to describe any pain and aching in your legs.\nYou also may need an ultrasound test to see if the valves in your veins are functioning normally or if there's any evidence of a blood clot. In this noninvasive test, a technician runs a small hand-held device (transducer), about the size of a bar of soap, against your skin over the area of your body being examined.

In this procedure, your doctor injects small- and medium-sized varicose veins with a solution or foam that scars and closes those veins. In a few weeks, treated varicose veins should fade.\n    Although the same vein may need to be injected more than once, sclerotherapy is effective if done correctly. Sclerotherapy doesn't require anesthesia and can be done in your doctor's office.\n    \n    Foam sclerotherapy of large veins. Injection of a large vein with a foam solution is also a possible treatment to close a vein and seal it.\n    Laser treatment. Doctors are using new technology in laser treatments to close off smaller varicose veins and spider veins. Laser treatment works by sending strong bursts of light onto the vein, which makes the vein slowly fade and disappear. No incisions or needles are used.\n    Catheter-assisted procedures using radiofrequency or laser energy. In one of these treatments, your doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) into an enlarged vein and heats the tip of the catheter using either radiofrequency or laser energy. As the catheter is pulled out, the heat destroys the vein by causing it to collapse and seal shut. This procedure is the preferred treatment for larger varicose veins.\n    High ligation and vein stripping. This procedure involves tying off a vein before it joins a deep vein and removing the vein through small incisions. This is an outpatient procedure for most people. Removing the vein won't keep blood from circulating in your leg because veins deeper in the leg take care of the larger volumes of blood.\n    Ambulatory phlebectomy (fluh-BEK-tuh-me). Your doctor removes smaller varicose veins through a series of tiny skin punctures. Only the parts of your leg that are being pricked are numbed in this outpatient procedure. Scarring is generally minimal.\n    Endoscopic vein surgery. You might need this operation only in an advanced case involving leg ulcers if other techniques fail. Your surgeon uses a thin video camera inserted in your leg to visualize and close varicose veins and then removes the veins through small incisions.

Doctors usually delay surgical treatments until you have the maturity to handle follow-up dilation.\n\nOptions for vaginoplasty surgery include:\n\n\nUsing a skin graft (McIndoe procedure). In the McIndoe procedure, your surgeon uses skin from your buttocks to create a vagina. Your surgeon makes an incision in the area where you'll have your vagina, inserts the skin graft to create the structure and places a mold in the newly formed canal. The mold remains in place for one week.\n\nAfter that, you use a vaginal dilator, similar to a firm tampon, which you remove when you use the bathroom or have sexual intercourse. After about three months, you'll use the dilator only at night. Sexual intercourse with artificial lubrication and occasional dilation helps you maintain a functional vagina.\n\nInserting a medical device (Vecchietti procedure). In the Vecchietti procedure, your surgeon places an olive-shaped device at your vaginal opening. Using a thin, lighted viewing instrument (laparoscope) as a guide, your surgeon connects the olive-shaped device to a separate traction device on your lower abdomen.\n\nYou tighten the traction device every day, gradually pulling the olive-shaped device inward to create a vagina over about a week. After your doctor removes the device, you'll need further manual dilation. Sexual intercourse will likely require artificial lubrication.\n\nUsing a portion of your colon (bowel vaginoplasty). In a bowel vaginoplasty, your surgeon diverts a portion of your colon to an opening in your genital area, creating a new vagina. Your surgeon then reconnects your remaining colon.

Beets, blackberries and rhubarb can turn urine red or pink.\nMedications. Rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), an antibiotic often used to treat tuberculosis, can turn urine reddish orange \u2014 as can phenazopyridine (Pyridium), a drug that numbs urinary tract discomfort, and laxatives containing senna.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Orange urineOrange urine can result from:\n\nMedications. Medications that can turn urine orange include the anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine (Azulfidine); phenazopyridine (Pyridium); some laxatives; and certain chemotherapy drugs.\nMedical conditions. In some cases, orange urine can indicate a problem with your liver or bile duct, especially if you also have light-colored stools. Dehydration, which can concentrate your urine and make it much deeper in color, can also make your urine appear orange.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Blue or green urineBlue or green urine can be caused by:\n\nDyes. Some brightly colored food dyes can cause green urine. Dyes used for some tests of kidney and bladder function can turn urine blue.\nMedications. A number of medications produce blue or green urine, including amitriptyline, indomethacin (Indocin, Tivorbex) and propofol (Diprivan).\nMedical conditions. Familial benign hypercalcemia, a rare inherited disorder, is sometimes called blue diaper syndrome because children with the disorder have blue urine. Green urine sometimes occurs during urinary tract infections caused by pseudomonas bacteria.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Dark brown or cola-colored urineBrown urine can result from:\n\nFood. Eating large amounts of fava beans, rhubarb or aloe can cause dark brown urine.\nMedications. A number of drugs can darken urine, including the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and primaquine, the antibiotics metronidazole (Flagyl) and nitrofurantoin (Furadantin), laxatives containing cascara or senna, and methocarbamol \u2014 a muscle relaxant.\nMedical conditions. Some liver and kidney disorders and some urinary tract infections can turn urine dark brown.\nExtreme exercise.

A sample of your urine is also likely to be checked for bacteria that cause infection.\nBlood tests. Certain blood tests measure the level of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen \u2014 waste products that build up in your bloodstream when your kidneys are damaged and not filtering properly. Your doctor might also check a sample of your blood for elevated levels of liver enzymes, and for conditions such as diabetes.\nMore InformationUrinalysis\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment, if needed, will depend on the condition that causes the change in urine color.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Test results can often be normal when reflux is present, but an endoscopy may detect inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) or other complications. An endoscopy can also be used to collect a sample of tissue (biopsy) to be tested for complications such as Barrett's esophagus.\n    Ambulatory acid (pH) probe test. A monitor is placed in your esophagus to identify when, and for how long, stomach acid regurgitates there. The monitor connects to a small computer that you wear around your waist or with a strap over your shoulder. The monitor might be a thin, flexible tube (catheter) that's threaded through your nose into your esophagus, or a clip that's placed in your esophagus during an endoscopy and that gets passed into your stool after about two days.\n    Esophageal manometry. This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in your esophagus when you swallow. Esophageal manometry also measures the coordination and force exerted by the muscles of your esophagus.\n    X-ray of your upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after you drink a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of your digestive tract. The coating allows your doctor to see a silhouette of your esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. You may also be asked to swallow a barium pill that can help diagnose a narrowing of the esophagus that may interfere with swallowing.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) care at Mayo ClinicNeedle biopsyUpper endoscopyX-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    GERD surgery\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGERD surgery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGERD surgery\n\t\t\t\tLaparoscopic anti-reflux surgery for GERD may involve a procedure to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter, called Nissen fundoplication.

If you don't experience relief within a few weeks, your doctor might recommend prescription medication or surgery.\n        \n            \n            Over-the-counter medicationsThe options include:\n\n    Antacids that neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. But antacids alone won't heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by stomach acid. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney problems.\n    Medications to reduce acid production. These medications \u2014 known as H-2-receptor blockers \u2014 include cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC) and nizatidine (Axid AR). H-2-receptor blockers don't act as quickly as antacids, but they provide longer relief and may decrease acid production from the stomach for up to 12 hours. Stronger versions are available by prescription.\n    Medications that block acid production and heal the esophagus. These medications \u2014 known as proton pump inhibitors \u2014 are stronger acid blockers than H-2-receptor blockers and allow time for damaged esophageal tissue to heal. Over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24 HR) and omeprazole (Prilosec OTC, Zegerid OTC).\n\n        \n            \n            Prescription medicationsPrescription-strength treatments for GERD include:\n\n    Prescription-strength H-2-receptor blockers. These include prescription-strength famotidine (Pepcid) and nizatidine. These medications are generally well-tolerated but long-term use may be associated with a slight increase in risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency and bone fractures.\n    Prescription-strength proton pump inhibitors. These include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant). Although generally well-tolerated, these medications might cause diarrhea, headache, nausea and vitamin B-12 deficiency. Chronic use might increase the risk of hip fracture.\n    Medication to strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter. Baclofen may ease GERD by decreasing the frequency of relaxations of the lower esophageal sphincter. Side effects might include fatigue or nausea.\n\n        \n            \n            Surgery and other proceduresGERD can usually be controlled with medication. But if medications don't help or you wish to avoid long-term medication use, your doctor might recommend:\n\n    Fundoplication. The surgeon wraps the top of your stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter, to tighten the muscle and prevent reflux. Fundoplication is usually done with a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure. The wrapping of the top part of the stomach can be partial or complete.\n    LINX device. A ring of tiny magnetic beads is wrapped around the junction of the stomach and esophagus. The magnetic attraction between the beads is strong enough to keep the junction closed to refluxing acid, but weak enough to allow food to pass through. The LINX device can be implanted using minimally invasive surgery.\n    \n    Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF). This new procedure involves tightening the lower esophageal sphincter by creating a partial wrap around the lower esophagus using polypropylene fasteners. TIF is performed through the mouth with a device called an endoscope and requires no surgical incision. Its advantages include quick recovery time and high tolerance.\n    If you have a large hiatal hernia, TIF alone is not an option. However, it may be possible if TIF is combined with laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

You rely on it virtually every time you walk and move your foot.\n\nRupture usually occurs in the section of the tendon situated within 2 1/2 inches (about 6 centimeters) of the point where it attaches to the heel bone. This section might be prone to rupture because blood flow is poor, which also can impair its ability to heal.\n\nRuptures often are caused by a sudden increase in the stress on your Achilles tendon. Common examples include:\n\nIncreasing the intensity of sports participation, especially in sports that involve jumping\nFalling from a height\nStepping into a hole\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During the physical exam, your doctor will inspect your lower leg for tenderness and swelling. Your doctor might be able to feel a gap in your tendon if it has ruptured completely.\n\nThe doctor might ask you to kneel on a chair or lie on your stomach with your feet hanging over the end of the exam table. He or she might then squeeze your calf muscle to see if your foot will automatically flex. If it doesn't, you probably have ruptured your Achilles tendon.\n\nIf there's a question about the extent of your Achilles tendon injury \u2014 whether it's completely or only partially ruptured \u2014 your doctor might order an ultrasound or MRI scan. These painless procedures create images of the tissues of your body.\nMore InformationMRI\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for a ruptured Achilles tendon often depends on your age, activity level and the severity of your injury. In general, younger and more active people, particularly athletes, tend to choose surgery to repair a completely ruptured Achilles tendon, while older people are more likely to opt for nonsurgical treatment.\n\nRecent studies, however, have shown fairly equal effectiveness of both surgical and nonsurgical management.\n\n        \n            \n            Nonsurgical treatmentThis approach typically involves:\n\nResting the tendon by using crutches\nApplying ice to the area\nTaking over-the-counter pain relievers\nKeeping the ankle from moving for the first few weeks, usually with a walking boot with heel wedges or a cast, with the foot flexed down\n\nNonoperative treatment avoids the risks associated with surgery, such as infection.\n\nHowever, a nonsurgical approach might increase your chances of re-rupture and recovery can take longer, although recent studies indicate favorable outcomes in people treated nonsurgically if they start rehabilitation with weight bearing early.\n\n        \n            \n            SurgeryThe procedure generally involves making an incision in the back of your lower leg and stitching the torn tendon together. Depending on the condition of the torn tissue, the repair might be reinforced with other tendons.\n\nComplications can include infection and nerve damage. Minimally invasive procedures reduce infection rates over those of open procedures.\n\n        \n            \n            RehabilitationAfter either treatment, you'll have physical therapy exercises to strengthen your leg muscles and Achilles tendon. Most people return to their former level of activity within four to six months. It's important to continue strength and stability training after that because some problems can persist for up to a year.\n\nA type of rehabilitation known as functional rehabilitation also focuses on coordination of body parts and how you move.

This common condition, which is present at birth (congential), causes two ureters to form on the same kidney. The second ureter can be normal or only partially developed. If either ureter doesn't function properly, urine can back up into the kidney and cause damage.\n    An abnormality where the ureter connects to the bladder or the kidney, which blocks urine flow. An abnormal connection between the ureter and kidney (ureteropelvic junction) may cause the kidney to swell and eventually stop working. This abnormality can be congenital or it can develop with normal childhood growth, result from an injury or scarring, or in rare cases, develop from a tumor. An abnormal connection between the ureter and bladder (ureterovesical junction) may cause urine to back up into the kidneys.\n    Ureterocele. If the ureter is too narrow and doesn't allow urine to flow normally, a tiny bulge in the ureter (ureterocele) may develop, usually in the section of the ureter closest to the bladder.

The chromosome analysis determines whether or not there is a missing X chromosome or abnormality of one of the X chromosomes.\n        \n            \n            Prenatal diagnosisA diagnosis is sometimes made during fetal development. Certain features on an ultrasound image may raise suspicion that your baby has Turner syndrome or another genetic condition affecting development in the womb.\nPrenatal screening tests that evaluate the baby's DNA in the mother's blood (prenatal cell-free DNA screening or noninvasive prenatal screening) may also indicate an increased risk of Turner syndrome. However, doing a karyotype during pregnancy or after delivery is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.\nYour pregnancy and childbirth specialist (obstetrician) may ask if you're interested in additional tests to make a diagnosis before your baby's birth. One of two procedures can be performed to test prenatally for Turner syndrome:\n\n    Chorionic villus sampling. This involves taking a small piece of tissue from the developing placenta. The placenta contains the same genetic material as the baby. The chorionic villus cells can be sent to the genetics laboratory for chromosome studies.\n    Amniocentesis. In this test, a sample of the amniotic fluid is taken from the uterus. The baby sheds cells into the amniotic fluid. The fluid can be sent to the genetics laboratory for study of the baby's chromosomes in these cells.\n\nDiscuss the benefits and risks of prenatal testing with your doctor.More InformationAmniocentesisChorionic villus samplingGenetic testing\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Because symptoms and complications vary, treatments are tailored to address your child's particular problems. Evaluation and monitoring for medical or mental health issues associated with Turner syndrome throughout life can help to address problems early.\nThe primary treatments for nearly all girls and women with Turner syndrome include hormone therapies:\n\n    Growth hormone. For most girls, growth hormone therapy \u2014 usually given daily as injections of recombinant human growth hormone \u2014 is recommended to increase height as much as possible at appropriate times during early childhood until the early teen years. Starting treatment early can improve height and bone growth. In girls with very short stature, the doctor may recommend oxandrolone in addition to the growth hormone. Oxandrolone is a hormone that helps to increase height by increasing the body's production of protein and improving bone mineral density.\n    Estrogen therapy. Most girls with Turner syndrome need to start estrogen and related hormone therapy in order to begin puberty. Often, estrogen therapy is started around age 11 or 12 years.  Estrogen helps to promote breast development and improve the size (volume) of the uterus. Estrogen helps with bone mineralization, and when used with growth hormone, may also help with height. Estrogen replacement therapy usually continues throughout life, until the average age of menopause is reached.\n\nOther treatments are tailored to address your child's particular problems as needed. Regular checkups have shown substantial improvements in the health and quality of life for girls and women with Turner syndrome.\nIt's important to help your child prepare for the transition from care with your pediatrician to adult medical and mental health care.

The \"doors\" of the chambers (valves) control the flow of blood, opening and closing to ensure that blood flows in a single direction.\nThe heart's four chambers are:\n\n    The right atrium, the upper right chamber, receives oxygen-poor blood from your body and delivers it into the right ventricle.\n    The right ventricle, the lower right chamber, pumps the blood through a large vessel called the pulmonary artery and into the lungs, where the blood is resupplied with oxygen.\n    The left atrium, the upper left chamber, receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it into the left ventricle.\n    The left ventricle, the lower left chamber, pumps the oxygen-rich blood through a large vessel called the aorta and on to the rest of the body.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Normal heart developmentThe formation of the fetal heart is complex. At a certain point, all babies have a single large vessel (truncus arteriosus) exiting the heart. During normal development of the heart, however, this very large single vessel divides into two parts.\nOne part becomes the lower portion of the aorta, which is attached to the left ventricle. The other part becomes the lower portion of the pulmonary artery, which is attached to the right ventricle.\nAlso during this process, the ventricles develop into two chambers separated by a wall (septum).\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Truncus arteriosus in newbornsIn babies born with truncus arteriosus, the single large vessel never finished dividing into two separate vessels and the wall separating the two ventricles never closed completely, resulting in a single blood vessel arising from the heart, and a large hole between the two chambers (ventricular septal defect).\nIn addition to the primary defects of truncus arteriosus, the valve controlling blood flow from the ventricles to the single large vessel (truncal valve) is often defective, so that it does not close completely, allowing blood to flow backward into the heart.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your baby's doctor will listen to your or your baby's lungs to assess his or her breathing and the possibility of fluid in the lungs.

For adults with truncus arteriosus, much of their medical care is provided by an adult congenital cardiologist along with a congenital cardiac surgeon and often a whole team of specialized staff.\nFor the pediatric or adult congenital cardiologist to check the condition of your or your baby's heart and make a diagnosis, he or she will order one or more tests:\n\n    \n    Echocardiogram.

Several conditions that affect the right ventricle, such as heart failure; conditions that cause high blood pressure in the arteries in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension); or an abnormal heart muscle condition (cardiomyopathy) also may cause the tricuspid valve to stop working properly.\nTricuspid valve regurgitation can also occur with heart conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as left-sided heart failure that leads to right-sided heart failure.\nTricuspid valve regurgitation can also be caused by valve problems due to:\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Ebstein anomaly\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tEbstein anomaly\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tEbstein anomaly\r\n\t\t\t\tEbstein anomaly is a rare heart defect in which the tricuspid valve \u2014 the valve between the upper right chamber (right atrium) and the lower right chamber (right ventricle) of the heart \u2014 isn't formed properly. As a result, blood leaks back through the valve and into the right atrium. Atrial septal defect is a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n    \n    Ebstein's anomaly. In this rare condition, the malformed tricuspid valve sits lower than normal in the right ventricle, and the tricuspid valve's leaflets are abnormally formed. This can lead to blood leaking backward (regurgitating) into the right atrium.\n    Tricuspid valve regurgitation in children is usually caused by heart disease present at birth (congenital heart disease). Ebstein's anomaly is the most common congenital heart disease that causes the condition. Tricuspid valve regurgitation in children may often be overlooked and not diagnosed until adulthood.\n    \n    Infective endocarditis. The tricuspid valve may be damaged by an infection of the lining of the heart (infective endocarditis) that can involve heart valves.\n    Carcinoid syndrome. In this rare condition, tumors that develop in your digestive system and spread to your liver or lymph nodes produce a hormonelike substance that can damage heart valves, most commonly the tricuspid valve and pulmonary valves.\n    Implantable device wires (leads). Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator wires can sometimes cause injury to the tricuspid valve during placement or removal of the implantable device.\n    Endomyocardial biopsy. In an endomyocardial biopsy, a small amount of heart muscle tissue is removed and tested for signs of inflammation or infection. Valve damage can sometimes occur during this procedure.\n    Blunt chest trauma. Experiencing trauma to your chest, such as in a car accident, can lead to tricuspid valve regurgitation.\n    Rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated strep throat that can damage heart valves, including the tricuspid valve, leading to tricuspid valve regurgitation later in life.\n    Congenital heart defects. Some heart defects present at birth (congenital) may affect the tricuspid valve. Most commonly this is Ebstein's anomaly.\n    Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder of connective tissue present at birth, is occasionally associated with tricuspid valve regurgitation.\n    Radiation. Chest radiation may damage the tricuspid valve and cause tricuspid valve regurgitation.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            How the heart works\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Chambers and valves of the heart\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tChambers and valves of the heart\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tChambers and valves of the heart\r\n\t\t\t\tA normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour heart, the center of your circulatory system, is made up of four chambers. The two upper chambers (atria) receive blood. The two lower chambers (ventricles) pump blood.\nFour heart valves open and close to let blood flow in one direction through your heart. The tricuspid valve \u2014 which lies between the two chambers on the right side of your heart \u2014 consists of three flaps of tissue called leaflets.\nThe tricuspid valve opens when blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Then the flaps close to prevent the blood that has just passed into the right ventricle from flowing backward.\nIn tricuspid valve regurgitation, the tricuspid valve doesn't close tightly. This causes the blood to flow back into the right atrium during each heartbeat.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Tricuspid valve regurgitation often has no symptoms, and you may be diagnosed incidentally when having tests for other conditions.\nIf you are having symptoms that suggest a heart condition, your doctor may review your medical history and conduct a physical examination.\n        \n            \n            TestsYour doctor may order several tests to diagnose tricuspid valve regurgitation, determine the severity and cause of your condition, and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Tests may include:\nEchocardiogram\nThis is the main test used to diagnose tricuspid valve regurgitation. In this test, sound waves produce detailed images of your heart. This test assesses the structure of your heart, the tricuspid valve and the blood flow through your heart. Your doctor also may order a 3-D echocardiogram.\n        \n            \n            \t\n\n    \n    Echocardiogram\n    An echocardiogram is conducted.\n\n\nYour doctor may also order a transesophageal echocardiogram. In this test, a doctor inserts a tube with a tiny sound device (transducer) into the part of your digestive tract that runs from your throat to your stomach (esophagus). Because the esophagus lies close to your heart, the transducer provides a detailed image of your heart.\nCardiac MRI\nA cardiac MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your heart. This test may be used to determine the severity of your condition and assess the size and function of your lower right heart chamber (right ventricle).\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\nIn this test, sensor patches with wires attached (electrodes) measure the electrical impulses given off by your heart. An ECG can detect enlarged chambers of your heart, heart disease and abnormal heart rhythms.\nChest X-ray\nIn a chest X-ray, your doctor studies the size and shape of your heart and evaluates your lungs.\nExercise tests or stress tests\nDifferent exercise tests help measure your activity tolerance and monitor your heart's response to physical exertion. If you are unable to exercise, medications to mimic the effect of exercise on your heart may be used.\nCardiac catheterization\nDoctors rarely use this test to diagnose tricuspid valve regurgitation. However, in some cases doctors may order it to determine certain causes of tricuspid valve regurgitation and to help decide on treatment.\nIn this procedure, doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) into a blood vessel in your groin, arm or neck and guide it to your heart using X-ray imaging. A special dye injected through the catheter helps your doctor see the blood flow through your heart, blood vessels and valves, and allows your doctor to check for abnormalities inside the heart and lungs. The pressure in the heart chambers and blood vessels can also be checked during this procedure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your tricuspid valve regurgitation-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationTricuspid valve regurgitation care at Mayo ClinicCardiac catheterizationChest X-raysEchocardiogramElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)EP studyMRINuclear stress testStress testShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for tricuspid valve regurgitation depends on the cause and severity of your condition. The goal of treatment is to reduce your symptoms, avoid future complications and live longer.\nIf an underlying condition such as heart failure or endocarditis is causing your tricuspid valve regurgitation, your doctors will treat that condition.\nYour treatment may include:\n        \n            \n            Regular monitoringIf you have mild tricuspid valve regurgitation, you may only need to have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to monitor your condition.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsYour doctor may prescribe medications to treat underlying conditions, such as drugs that prevent water retention (diuretics) and other medications for people with heart failure or medications to help control your heart rate if you have a heart rhythm disorder (arrhythmia).\n        \n            \n            SurgeryYour doctor may recommend surgery to repair or replace the tricuspid valve if you have severe tricuspid valve regurgitation and you're experiencing signs or symptoms, or if your heart begins to enlarge and heart function begins to decrease. In some cases, your doctor may recommend surgery for severe tricuspid valve regurgitation even if you don't have symptoms but your heart is enlarging. Your doctor will evaluate you and determine if you're a candidate for heart valve repair or replacement.\nIf you have tricuspid valve regurgitation and you're having heart surgery to treat other heart conditions, such as mitral valve surgery, your doctor may recommend that you have tricuspid valve surgery at the same time.\nSurgical options include:\n\n    Heart valve repair. Surgeons try to repair the heart valve instead of replacing it whenever possible. Your surgeon may perform valve repair by separating tethered valve leaflets, closing holes in leaflets, or reshaping the valve leaflets so that they can make contact with each other and prevent backward flow. Surgeons may often tighten or reinforce the ring around a valve (annulus) by implanting an artificial ring.\n    Some surgeons perform cone repair, a newer form of tricuspid valve repair, to repair tricuspid valves in people with Ebstein's anomaly. In the cone reconstruction, surgeons separate the leaflets of the tricuspid valve from the underlying heart muscle. The leaflets are then rotated and reattached, creating a \"leaflet cone.\"\n    \n\n        \n            \n            \n\n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n (function() {\n    kWidget.embed({\"targetId\":\"kaltura-video-1_vnj19rt9\",\"wid\":\"_1825021\",\"uiconf_id\":44373111,\"flashvars\":{\"IframeCustomPluginCss1\":\"/-/media/kcms/ux/css/kaltura-player.css\",\"localizationCode\":\"auto\",\"autoPlay\":false},\"cache_st\":20200805,\"entry_id\":\"1_vnj19rt9\",\"readyCallback\": function(playerId) {var kdp = document.getElementById(playerId); kdp.addJsListener('doPlay', 'doPlayCallback'); window.inlineReadyCallbackCalled = playerId; }});\n  })();\n \n\nThe cone procedure\n\nIn the cone procedure for tricuspid valve repair, the surgeon isolates the deformed leaflets of the tricuspid valve and reshapes them so that they function properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n    Repair leaves you with your own functioning tissue, which is resistant to infection and doesn't require blood-thinning medication, and optimizes function of the right ventricle.\n    \n    Heart valve replacement. If your tricuspid valve can't be repaired, your surgeon may perform tricuspid valve replacement. In tricuspid valve replacement, your surgeon removes the damaged valve and replaces it with a mechanical valve or a valve made from cow, pig or human heart tissue (biological tissue valve).\n    Biological tissue valves degenerate over time, and often eventually need to be replaced.\n    Mechanical valves are used less often to replace tricuspid valves than to replace mitral or aortic valves. If you have a mechanical valve, you'll need to take blood-thinning medications for life to prevent blood clots. Your doctor can discuss the risks and benefits of each type of heart valve with you and discuss which valve may be appropriate for you.\n    \n    \n    Catheter procedure. In some cases, if your biological tissue valve replacement is no longer working, doctors may conduct a catheter procedure to replace the valve. In this procedure, doctors insert a catheter with a balloon at the end into a blood vessel in your neck or leg and thread it to the heart using imaging. A replacement valve is inserted through the catheter and guided to the heart.\n    Doctors then inflate the balloon in the biological tissue valve in the heart, and place the replacement valve inside the valve that is no longer working properly. The new valve is then expanded.\n    \n\nMaze procedure\nIf you have fast heart rhythms, your surgeon may perform the maze procedure during valve repair or replacement to correct the fast heart rhythms. In this procedure, a surgeon makes small incisions in the upper chambers of your heart to create a pattern or maze of scar tissue.\nBecause scar tissue doesn't conduct electricity, it interferes with stray electrical impulses that cause some types of fast heart rhythms. Extreme cold (cryotherapy) or radiofrequency energy also may be used to create the scars.\n        \n            \n            Catheter ablationIf you have fast or abnormal heart rhythms, your doctor may perform catheter ablation. In this procedure, your doctor threads one or more catheters through your blood vessels to your heart. Electrodes at the catheter tips can use heat, extreme cold or radiofrequency energy to damage (ablate) a small spot of heart tissue and create an electrical block along the pathway that's causing your arrhythmia.More InformationTricuspid valve regurgitation care at Mayo ClinicCardiac ablationHeart valve surgeryMinimally invasive heart surgeryTricuspid valve repair and tricuspid valve replacementLeaky Valve Cone ProcedureShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour heart is divided into four chambers \u2014 the right atrium and right ventricle and left atrium and left ventricle. The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen before it circulates to your heart's left side. The left side pumps blood into a large vessel called the aorta, which circulates the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body.\nValves control the flow of blood into and out of your heart. These valves open to allow blood to move to the next chamber or one of the arteries, and they close to keep blood from flowing backward.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When things go wrongIn tricuspid atresia, the right side of the heart can't pump enough blood to the lungs because the tricuspid valve is missing. A sheet of tissue blocks the flow of blood from the right atrium to the right ventricle. As a result, the right ventricle is usually small and underdeveloped (hypoplastic).\nBlood instead flows from the right atrium to the left atrium through a hole in the wall between them (septum). This hole is either a heart defect (atrial septal defect) or an enlarged natural opening that's supposed to close soon after birth (patent foramen ovale).\nAfter the blood flows to the left atrium, it enters the left ventricle and then is pumped to the aorta. To get to the lungs, blood flows through a vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery (ductus arteriosus). All hearts have a ductus arteriosus while the baby is in the uterus, but shortly after birth, the ductus closes.\nA baby with tricuspid atresia might need medication to keep the ductus from closing after birth. A procedure or surgery to create an opening between the atria or to provide a connection from the aorta to the pulmonary artery might be needed.\nMany babies born with tricuspid atresia have a hole between the ventricles (ventricular septal defect). In these cases, some blood can flow through the hole between the left ventricle and the right ventricle, and then blood is pumped to the lungs through the pulmonary artery.\nHowever, the valve between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery (pulmonary valve) might be narrowed, which can reduce blood flow to the lungs. If the pulmonary valve isn't narrowed and if the ventricular septal defect is large, too much blood can flow to the lungs, which can lead to heart failure.\nSome babies have other heart defects as well.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Before birthBecause of advances in ultrasound technology, doctors can usually identify tricuspid atresia on a routine ultrasound exam during gestation.\n        \n            \n            After birthYour baby's doctor might suspect a heart defect, such as tricuspid atresia, if your newborn has blue-tinged skin or is having trouble breathing.\nAnother indication is hearing an abnormal whooshing sound caused by blood not flowing properly (heart murmur), when listening to your baby's heart during a physical exam.\nIf tricuspid atresia is suspected, your baby's doctor might order tests including:\n\n    Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves that bounce off your baby's heart to produce moving images the doctor can view on a video screen. In a baby with tricuspid atresia, the echocardiogram reveals the absence of a tricuspid valve, irregular blood flow and other heart defects.\n    Electrocardiogram (ECG). This test records the electrical activity of the heart and can determine whether the heart's chambers are enlarged, or the heart rhythm is abnormal.\n    Pulse oximetry. This measures the oxygen in your or your baby's blood using a sensor placed over the end of your or your baby's finger.\n    Chest X-ray. This might show whether the heart and its chambers are enlarged. It can also show whether there is too much or too little blood flow to the lungs.\n    Cardiac catheterization. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel at your child's groin and guided into the heart. Rarely used to diagnose tricuspid atresia, this test might be used to examine the heart before surgery to treat tricuspid atresia.\nMore InformationEchocardiogramUltrasound\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "There's no way to replace a tricuspid valve in tricuspid atresia. Treatment involves surgery to ensure enough blood flow through the heart and into the lungs.\nOften, this requires more than one surgery. Medications to strengthen the heart muscle, lower blood pressure and rid the baby's body of excess fluid and supplemental oxygen to help the baby breathe also might be given before surgery.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsBefore surgery, your child's cardiologist might recommend that your child take the hormone prostaglandin to help widen (dilate) and keep open the ductus arteriosus.\n        \n            \n            Surgeries or other proceduresSome of the procedures used to treat tricuspid atresia are a temporary fix to increase blood flow (palliative surgeries). Procedures that might be needed include:\n\n    Atrial septostomy. Rarely, a balloon is used to create or enlarge the opening between the heart's upper chambers to allow more blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium.\n    \n    Shunting. This creates a bypass (shunt) from a main blood vessel leading out of the heart to the blood vessel leading to the lungs (pulmonary artery), which improves oxygen levels.\n    Surgeons generally implant a shunt during the first two weeks of life. However, babies usually outgrow this shunt and might need another surgery to replace it.\n    \n    Pulmonary artery band placement. If your baby has a ventricular septal defect and too much blood flowing to the lungs from the heart, a surgeon might place a band around the pulmonary artery to reduce the flow.\n    \n    Glenn operation. When babies outgrow the first shunt, they often require this surgery, which sets the stage for the more permanent corrective surgery, called the Fontan procedure.\n    Doctors usually perform the Glenn operation when a child is between 3 and 6 months old. Doctors remove the first shunt, then connect one of the large veins that normally returns blood to the heart (the superior vena cava) to the pulmonary artery instead.\n    This procedure allows blood to flow directly to the lungs and reduces the workload on the left ventricle, decreasing the risk of damage to it.\n    \n    \n    Fontan procedure. A variation of this standard treatment of tricuspid atresia is usually done when the child is 2 to 5 years old. In general, the surgeon creates a path for the blood that's returning to the heart (the inferior vena cava) to flow directly into the pulmonary arteries, which then transport the blood into the lungs.\n    Doctors sometimes leave an opening between the pathway and the right atrium (fenestration).\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Follow-up careTo monitor heart health, you or your child will need lifelong follow-up care with a cardiologist who specializes in congenital heart disease.\nYour or your child's cardiologist will tell you whether you or your child needs to take preventive antibiotics before dental and other procedures. In some cases, your child's cardiologist might recommend limiting vigorous physical activity.\nThe short- and intermediate-term outlook for children who have a Fontan procedure is generally promising.

In nature, animals are infected when they feed on other infected animals. Pigs and horses can become infected with trichinosis when they feed on garbage containing infected meat scraps. Cattle don't eat meat, but some cases of trichinosis in humans have been linked to eating beef that was mixed with infected pork or ground in a grinder previously used for contaminated pork.\nDue to increased regulation of pork feed and products in the United States, pigs have become a less common source of infection. Wild animals, including bear, continue to be sources of infection.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Trichinella larvae travel from the small intestine through the arteries to bury themselves inside muscle tissue, so stool sample tests don't often show evidence of the parasite. Your doctor can diagnose trichinella infection by performing a physical exam and discussing your signs and symptoms such as swelling around the eyes, muscle inflammation and fever.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, your doctor might use these tests:\n\n    Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample and test it for signs suggesting trichinosis \u2014 an increase in the number of a certain type of white blood cell (eosinophils) or the formation of antibodies against the parasite after several weeks.\n    Muscle biopsy. While a blood test typically is enough to establish a diagnosis, your doctor might also recommend a muscle biopsy. A small piece of muscle is removed and examined under a microscope to look for trichinella larvae.\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Trichinosis usually isn't serious and often gets better on its own, usually within a few months. However, fatigue, mild pain, weakness and diarrhea may linger for months or years. Your doctor may prescribe medications depending on your symptoms and the severity of infection.\n\n    \n    Anti-parasitic medication. Anti-parasitic medication is the first line of treatment for trichinosis. If the trichinella parasite is discovered early, albendazole (Albenza) or mebendazole (Emverm) can be effective in eliminating the worms and larvae in the intestine. You may have mild gastrointestinal side effects during the course of treatment.\n    If the disease is discovered after the larvae bury themselves in muscle tissues, the benefit of anti-parasitic medications is less certain. Your doctor might prescribe one if you have central nervous system, cardiac or respiratory problems as a result of the invasion.\n    \n    Pain relievers. After muscle invasion, your doctor may prescribe pain relievers to help relieve muscle aches. Eventually, the larvae cysts in your muscles tend to calcify, resulting in destruction of the larvae and the end of muscle aches and fatigue.\n    Corticosteroids. Some cases of trichinosis cause allergic reactions when the parasite enters muscle tissue or when dead or dying larvae release chemicals in your muscle tissue. Your doctor might prescribe a corticosteroid to control inflammation.\n\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

The degree of damage can depend on several factors, including the nature of the injury and the force of impact.\nCommon events causing traumatic brain injury include the following:\n\n\tFalls. Falls from bed or a ladder, down stairs, in the bath, and other falls are the most common cause of traumatic brain injury overall, particularly in older adults and young children.\n\tVehicle-related collisions. Collisions involving cars, motorcycles or bicycles \u2014 and pedestrians involved in such accidents \u2014 are a common cause of traumatic brain injury.\n\tViolence. Gunshot wounds, domestic violence, child abuse and other assaults are common causes. Shaken baby syndrome is a traumatic brain injury in infants caused by violent shaking.\n\tSports injuries. Traumatic brain injuries may be caused by injuries from a number of sports, including soccer, boxing, football, baseball, lacrosse, skateboarding, hockey, and other high-impact or extreme sports. These are particularly common in youth.\n\t\n\t\tExplosive blasts and other combat injuries. Explosive blasts are a common cause of traumatic brain injury in active-duty military personnel. Although how the damage occurs isn't yet well understood, many researchers believe that the pressure wave passing through the brain significantly disrupts brain function.\n\t\tTraumatic brain injury also results from penetrating wounds, severe blows to the head with shrapnel or debris, and falls or bodily collisions with objects following a blast.\n\t\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Traumatic brain injuries may be emergencies.

People who've had a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury are at risk of having seizures during the first week after their injury.\n    An anti-seizure drug may be given during the first week to avoid any additional brain damage that might be caused by a seizure. Continued anti-seizure treatments are used only if seizures occur.\n    \n    Coma-inducing drugs. Doctors sometimes use drugs to put people into temporary comas because a comatose brain needs less oxygen to function. This is especially helpful if blood vessels, compressed by increased pressure in the brain, are unable to supply brain cells with normal amounts of nutrients and oxygen.\n    Diuretics. These drugs reduce the amount of fluid in tissues and increase urine output. Diuretics, given intravenously to people with traumatic brain injury, help reduce pressure inside the brain.\n\n        \n            \n            SurgeryEmergency surgery may be needed to minimize additional damage to brain tissues. Surgery may be used to address the following problems:\n\n    Removing clotted blood (hematomas). Bleeding outside or within the brain can result in a collection of clotted blood (hematoma) that puts pressure on the brain and damages brain tissue.\n    Repairing skull fractures. Surgery may be needed to repair severe skull fractures or to remove pieces of skull in the brain.\n    Bleeding in the brain. Head injuries that cause bleeding in the brain may need surgery to stop the bleeding.\n    Opening a window in the skull. Surgery may be used to relieve pressure inside the skull by draining accumulated cerebrospinal fluid or creating a window in the skull that provides more room for swollen tissues.\n\n        \n            \n            RehabilitationMost people who have had a significant brain injury will require rehabilitation. They may need to relearn basic skills, such as walking or talking. The goal is to improve their abilities to perform daily activities.\nTherapy usually begins in the hospital and continues at an inpatient rehabilitation unit, a residential treatment facility or through outpatient services. The type and duration of rehabilitation is different for everyone, depending on the severity of the brain injury and what part of the brain was injured.\nRehabilitation specialists may include:\n\n    Physiatrist, a doctor trained in physical medicine and rehabilitation, who oversees the entire rehabilitation process, manages medical rehabilitation problems and prescribes medication as needed\n    Occupational therapist, who helps the person learn, relearn or improve skills to perform everyday activities\n    Physical therapist, who helps with mobility and relearning movement patterns, balance and walking\n    Speech and language therapist, who helps the person improve communication skills and use assistive communication devices if necessary\n    Neuropsychologist, who assesses cognitive impairment and performance, helps the person manage behaviors or learn coping strategies, and provides psychotherapy as needed for emotional and psychological well-being\n    Social worker or case manager, who facilitates access to service agencies, assists with care decisions and planning, and facilitates communication among various professionals, care providers and family members\n    Rehabilitation nurse, who provides ongoing rehabilitation care and services and who helps with discharge planning from the hospital or rehabilitation facility\n    Traumatic brain injury nurse specialist, who helps coordinate care and educates the family about the injury and recovery process\n    Recreational therapist, who assists with time management and leisure activities\n    Vocational counselor, who assesses the ability to return to work and appropriate vocational opportunities and who provides resources for addressing common challenges in the workplace\nMore InformationBrain rehabilitation\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},
{"Diseases": "Transverse myelitis", "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of transverse myelitis usually develop over a few hours to a few days and may sometimes progress gradually over several weeks.\nTransverse myelitis usually affects both sides of the body below the affected area of the spinal cord, but sometimes there are symptoms on just one side of the body.\nTypical signs and symptoms include:\n\n    Pain. Transverse myelitis pain may begin suddenly in your lower back. Sharp pain may shoot down your legs or arms or around your chest or abdomen. Pain symptoms vary based on the part of your spinal cord that's affected.\n    Abnormal sensations. Some people with transverse myelitis report sensations of numbness, tingling, coldness or burning. Some are especially sensitive to the light touch of clothing or to extreme heat or cold. You may feel as if something is tightly wrapping the skin of your chest, abdomen or legs.\n    Weakness in your arms or legs. Some people notice heaviness in the legs, or that they're stumbling or dragging one foot. Others may develop severe weakness or even total paralysis.\n    Bladder and bowel problems. This may include needing to urinate more frequently, urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating and constipation.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorCall your doctor or get emergency medical care if you're experiencing signs and symptoms of transverse myelitis. A number of neurological disorders can cause sensory problems, weakness, and bladder or bowel dysfunction including compression of the spinal cord, which is a surgical emergency.\nAnother less common cause is a stroke of the spinal cord due to impaired blood circulation. This can be caused by blockage of a blood vessel that supplies blood to the spinal cord, which may occur with surgery of the aorta or increased clotting of the blood.

Sometimes there is no known cause.\nViral, bacterial and fungal infections affecting the spinal cord may cause transverse myelitis. In most cases, the inflammatory disorder appears after recovery from the infection.\nViruses associated with transverse myelitis are:\n\n    Herpes viruses, including the one that causes shingles and chickenpox (zoster)\n    Cytomegalovirus\n    Epstein-Barr\n    HIV\n    Enteroviruses such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus\n    West Nile\n    Echovirus\n    Zika\n    Influenza\n    Hepatitis B\n    Mumps, measles and rubella\n\nOther viruses may trigger an autoimmune reaction without directly infecting the spinal cord.\nBacterial infections that are associated with transverse myelitis include:\n\n    Lyme disease\n    Syphilis\n    Tuberculosis\n    Actinomyces\n    Pertussis\n    Tetanus\n    Diphtheria\n\nBacterial skin infections, gastroenteritis and certain types of bacterial pneumonia also may cause transverse myelitis.\nRarely, parasites and fungal infections may infect the spinal cord.\nThere are a number of inflammatory conditions that appear to cause the disorder:\n\n    Multiple sclerosis is a disorder in which the immune system destroys myelin surrounding nerves in your spinal cord and brain. Transverse myelitis can be the first sign of multiple sclerosis or represent a relapse. Transverse myelitis as a sign of multiple sclerosis usually causes symptoms on only one side of your body.\n    \n    Neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease) is a condition that causes inflammation and myelin loss around the spinal cord and the nerve in your eye that transmits information to your brain. Transverse myelitis associated with neuromyelitis optica usually affects both sides of your body.\n    In addition to transverse myelitis, you may experience symptoms of damage to myelin of the optic nerve, including pain in the eye with movement and temporary vision loss. This can happen with or separately from transverse myelitis symptoms. However, some people with neuromyelitis optica don't experience eye-related problems and might have only recurrent episodes of transverse myelitis.\n    \n    \n    Autoimmune disorders probably contribute to transverse myelitis in some people. These disorders include lupus, which can affect multiple body systems, and Sjogren's syndrome, which causes severe dryness of the mouth and eyes.\n    Transverse myelitis associated with an autoimmune disorder may be a warning sign of neuromyelitis optica. Neuromyelitis optica occurs more frequently in people with other autoimmune diseases.\n    \n    Vaccinations for infectious diseases have occasionally been associated as a possible trigger. However, at this time the association is not strong enough to warrant limiting any vaccine.\n    Sarcoidosis is a condition that leads to inflammation in many areas of the body, including the spinal cord and optic nerve. It may mimic neuromyelitis optica, but typically sarcoidosis symptoms develop more slowly. The cause of sarcoidosis isn't understood.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "A doctor will diagnose transverse myelitis based on your answers to questions about your signs and symptoms, your medical history, a clinical assessment of nerve function, and test results.\nThese tests, which may indicate inflammation of the spinal cord and rule out other disorders, include the following:\n\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create 3D images of soft tissues. An MRI can show inflammation of the spinal cord and other potential causes of the symptoms, including abnormalities affecting the spinal cord or blood vessels.\n    \n    Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) uses a needle to draw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the protective fluid that surrounds your spinal cord and brain.\n    In some people with transverse myelitis, CSF may have abnormally high numbers of white blood cells or immune system proteins that indicate inflammation. Spinal fluid can also be tested for viral infections or certain cancers.\n    \n    \n    Blood tests may include a test that checks for antibodies associated with neuromyelitis optica, a condition in which inflammation occurs both in your spinal cord and in the nerve in your eye. People with a positive antibody test are at increased risk of experiencing multiple attacks of transverse myelitis and require treatment to prevent future attacks.\n    Other blood tests can identify infections that may contribute to transverse myelitis, or rule out other causes of symptoms.\n    \nMore InformationLumbar puncture (spinal tap)MRI\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Several therapies target the acute signs and symptoms of transverse myelitis:\n\n    Intravenous steroids. You'll probably receive steroids through a vein in your arm over the course of several days. Steroids help reduce the inflammation in your spinal column.\n    \n    Plasma exchange therapy. People who don't respond to intravenous steroids may need plasma exchange therapy. This involves removing the straw-colored fluid in which blood cells are suspended (plasma) and replacing the plasma with special fluids.\n    It's not certain how this therapy helps people with transverse myelitis, but it may be that plasma exchange removes inflammatory antibodies.\n    \n    Antiviral medication. Some people who have a viral infection of the spinal cord may be treated with medications to treat the virus.\n    \n    Pain medication. Chronic pain is a common complication of transverse myelitis. Medications that may lessen muscle pain include common pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve.)\n    Nerve pain may be treated with antidepressant drugs, such as sertraline (Zoloft), and anticonvulsant drugs, such as gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise) or pregabalin (Lyrica).\n    \n    Medications to treat other complications. Your doctor may prescribe other medications as needed to treat problems such as muscle spasticity, urinary or bowel dysfunction, depression, or other complications associated with transverse myelitis.\n    Medications to prevent recurrent attacks of transverse myelitis. People who have antibodies associated with neuromyelitis optica need ongoing medications, such as corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants, to reduce their chances of more transverse myelitis attacks or developing optic neuritis.\n\n        \n            \n            Other therapiesAdditional therapies focus on long-term recovery and care:\n\n    Physical therapy. This helps improve strength and coordination. Your physical therapist can teach you how to use any needed assistive devices, such as a wheelchair, canes or braces.\n    Occupational therapy. This helps people with transverse myelitis learn new ways of performing day-to-day activities, such as bathing, preparing a meal and housecleaning.\n    Psychotherapy. A psychotherapist can use talk therapy to treat anxiety, depression, sexual dysfunction, and other emotional or behavioral issues from coping with transverse myelitis.\n\n        \n            \n            PrognosisAlthough most people with transverse myelitis have at least partial recovery, it may take a year or more. Most recovery occurs within the first three months after the episode and strongly depends on the cause of transverse myelitis.\nAbout one-third of people with transverse myelitis fall into one of three categories after an attack:\n\n    No or slight disability. These people experience only minimal lingering symptoms.\n    Moderate disability. These people are mobile, but may have difficulty walking, numbness or tingling, and bladder and bowel problems.\n    Severe disability. Some people may permanently need a wheelchair and require ongoing assistance with daily care and activities.\n\nIt's difficult to predict the course of transverse myelitis. The prognosis and responsiveness to treatment is strongly determined by the cause of the syndrome and to some extent by how early treatment is administered.

Why this defect occurs is unknown in most cases.\nNormally, the pulmonary artery \u2014 which carries blood from your heart to your lungs to receive oxygen \u2014 is attached to the lower right chamber (right ventricle).\nFrom your lungs, the oxygen-rich blood goes to your heart's upper left chamber (left atrium), through the mitral valve into the lower left chamber (left ventricle). The aorta is normally attached to the left ventricle. It carries oxygen-rich blood out of your heart back to the rest of your body.\nIn transposition of the great arteries, the positions of the pulmonary artery and the aorta are switched. The pulmonary artery is connected to the left ventricle, and the aorta is connected to the right ventricle.\nOxygen-poor blood circulates through the right side of the heart and back to the body without passing through the lungs. Oxygen-rich blood circulates through the left side of the heart and directly back into the lungs without being circulated to the rest of the body.\nCirculation of oxygen-poor blood through the body causes the skin to have a blue tint (cyanosis). Because of this, transposition of the great arteries is called a cyanotic congenital heart defect.\nAlthough some factors, such as genetics, rubella or other viral illnesses during pregnancy, maternal age over 40, or maternal diabetes, may increase the risk of this condition, in most cases the cause is unknown.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Levo-transposition of the great arteriesIn this rare type of transposition of the great arteries \u2014 called levo-transposition of the great arteries or sometimes referred to as congenitally corrected transposition \u2014 the two ventricles are switched so that the left ventricle is on the heart's right side and receives blood from the right atrium, and the right ventricle is on the heart's left side and receives blood from the left atrium. This type of transposition of the great arteries is sometimes also called congenitally corrected transposition.\nHowever, the blood usually circulates correctly through the heart and body. The right-sided left ventricle attaches to the pulmonary artery, which delivers oxygen-poor blood to the lungs, while the left-sided right ventricle attaches to the aorta, which carries oxygen-rich blood to the body.\nBecause the circulation is congenitally corrected, some people with this rare condition may not experience symptoms for many years and go undiagnosed until adulthood. However, many people with this condition have other congenital heart defects that may cause symptoms, and these people are usually found to have heart disease as children. Depending on their condition and heart defects, people may have surgery to repair the defects.\nThe right ventricle may not function well as the main pumping chamber over time, which can lead to heart failure in adults. Adults often also have abnormal function of the valve guarding the right ventricle (tricuspid valve). Abnormal valve and ventricular function can cause heart failure. Treatment such as valve replacement, ventricular assist devices or a heart transplant may eventually be needed.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Although it's possible your baby's transposition of the great arteries may be diagnosed before birth, it can be difficult to diagnose. Prenatal tests for transposition of the great arteries aren't usually done unless your doctor suspects your baby may have congenital heart disease.\nAfter your baby is born, his or her doctor will immediately suspect a heart defect such as transposition of the great arteries if your baby has blue-tinged skin (cyanosis) or if your baby is having trouble breathing.\nSometimes, the bluish skin color isn't as noticeable if your baby has another heart defect, such as a hole in the wall separating the left and right chambers of the heart (septum), that's allowing some oxygen-rich blood to travel through the body. If the hole is in the upper chambers of the heart, it's called an atrial septal defect. In the lower chambers of the heart, the defect is called a ventricular septal defect.\nIt's also possible your baby could have a patent ductus arteriosus \u2014 an opening between the heart's two major blood vessels, the aorta and the pulmonary artery \u2014 that allows oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix.\nAs your baby becomes more active, the heart defects won't allow enough blood through and eventually the cyanosis will become obvious.\nYour baby's doctor may also suspect a heart defect if he or she hears a heart murmur \u2014 an abnormal whooshing sound caused by turbulent blood flow.\nA physical exam alone isn't enough to accurately diagnose transposition of the great arteries. One or more of the following tests are necessary for an accurate diagnosis:\n\n    \n    Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart \u2014 it uses sound waves that bounce off your baby's heart and produce moving images that can be viewed on a video screen. Doctors use this test to diagnose transposition of the great arteries by looking at the position of the aorta and the pulmonary artery.\n    Echocardiograms can also identify associated heart defects, such as a ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus.\n    \n    \n    Cardiac catheterization. This procedure is typically done only when other tests, such as an echocardiogram, don't show enough information to make a diagnosis.\n    During a cardiac catheterization, the doctor inserts a thin flexible tube (catheter) into an artery or vein in your baby's groin and directs it up to his or her heart. A dye is injected through the catheter to make your baby's heart structures visible on X-ray pictures. The catheter also measures pressure in the chambers of your baby's heart and in the blood vessels and can measure the amount of oxygen in the blood.\n    Cardiac catheterization may be done urgently to perform a temporary treatment for transposition of the great arteries (balloon atrial septostomy).\n    \n    Chest X-ray. Although a chest X-ray doesn't provide a definitive diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries, it does allow the doctor to see your baby's heart size and the position of the aorta and pulmonary artery.\n    Electrocardiogram. An electrocardiogram records the electrical activity in the heart each time it contracts. During this procedure, patches with wires (electrodes) are placed on your baby's chest, wrists and ankles. The electrodes measure electrical activity, which is recorded on paper.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your transposition of the great arteries-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationTransposition of the great arteries care at Mayo ClinicCardiac catheterizationChest X-raysEchocardiogramElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)Show more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "All infants with transposition of the great arteries need surgery to correct the defect.\n        \n            \n            Before surgeryYour baby's doctor may recommend several options to help manage the condition before corrective surgery. They include:\n\n    Medication. The medication prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) helps keep the connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery open (ductus arteriosus), increasing blood flow and improving mixing of oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich blood until surgery can be performed.\n    Atrial septostomy. This procedure \u2014 usually done using cardiac catheterization rather than surgery \u2014 enlarges a natural connection between the heart's upper chambers (atria). It allows for the oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix and results in improved oxygen delivery to your baby's body.\n\n        \n            \n            SurgerySurgical options include:\n\n    \n    Arterial switch operation. This is the most common surgery used to correct transposition of the great arteries. Surgeons usually perform this surgery within the first month of life.\n    During an arterial switch operation, the pulmonary artery and the aorta are moved to their normal positions: The pulmonary artery is connected to the right ventricle, and the aorta is connected to the left ventricle. The coronary arteries also are reattached to the aorta.\n    If your baby has a ventricular septal defect or an atrial septal defect, those holes usually are closed during surgery. In some cases, however, the doctor may leave small ventricular septal defects to close on their own.\n    \n    \n    Atrial switch operation. In this surgery, the surgeon makes a tunnel (baffle) between the heart's two upper chambers (atria). This diverts the oxygen-poor blood to the left ventricle and the pulmonary artery and the oxygen-rich blood to the right ventricle and the aorta.\n    With this procedure, the right ventricle must pump blood to the body, instead of just to the lungs as it would do in a normal heart. Possible complications of the atrial switch operation include irregular heartbeats, baffle obstructions or leaks, and heart failure due to long-term problems with right ventricle function.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            After surgeryAfter corrective surgery, your baby will need lifelong follow-up care with a heart doctor (cardiologist) who specializes in congenital heart disease to monitor his or her heart health. The cardiologist may recommend that your child avoid certain activities, such as weightlifting or competitive sports, because they raise blood pressure and may stress the heart.\nTalk to your or your child's doctor about what type of physical activities you or your child can do, and how much and how often.\nMany people who undergo the arterial switch operation don't need additional surgery. However, some complications, such as arrhythmias, heart valve leaks or problems with the heart's pumping, may require additional treatment.\n        \n            \n            Long-term careYou or your child will need to be monitored and treated throughout your life. Your child will be monitored and have regular follow-up appointments with a pediatric cardiologist. As your child grows older, his or her care will transition to an adult congenital cardiologist, who can monitor his or her condition over time. Transposition of the great arteries can affect your child's adult life, as it can contribute to other health problems. Adults who have congenital heart defects may need other treatments for their condition.\n        \n            \n            PregnancyIf you had transposition of the great arteries repaired in your infancy, it's possible for you to have a healthy pregnancy, but specialized care may be necessary. If you're thinking about becoming pregnant, talk to your cardiologist and obstetrician before conceiving.\nIf you have complications, such as arrhythmias or serious heart muscle problems, pregnancy may pose risks to both you and your fetus. In some situations, such as for women who have severe complications of their heart defect, pregnancy isn't recommended even for those with a repaired transposition.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma:\n\n    Inflammation \u2014 follicular. The early infection has five or more follicles \u2014 small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell \u2014 visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva).\n    Inflammation \u2014 intense. In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid.\n    Eyelid scarring. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion).\n    In-turned eyelashes (trichiasis). The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea).\n    Corneal clouding (opacity). The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea.\n\nAll the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid.

Your doctor may prescribe tetracycline eye ointment or oral azithromycin (Zithromax). Azithromycin appears to be more effective than tetracycline, but it's more expensive.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends giving antibiotics to an entire community when more than 10% of children have been affected by trachoma. The goal of this guideline is to treat anyone who has been exposed to trachoma and reduce the spread of trachoma.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryTreatment of later stages of trachoma \u2014 including painful eyelid deformities \u2014 may require surgery.\nIn eyelid rotation surgery (bilamellar tarsal rotation), your doctor makes an incision in your scarred lid and rotates your eyelashes away from your cornea. The procedure limits the progression of corneal scarring and may help prevent further loss of vision.\nIf your cornea has become clouded enough to seriously impair your vision, corneal transplantation may be an option that could improve vision.\nYou may have a procedure to remove eyelashes (epilation) in some cases.

You may accidentally ingest the parasites if you touch your mouth after gardening, cleaning a litter box or touching anything that has come in contact with infected cat feces. Cats who hunt or who are fed raw meat are most likely to harbor T. gondii.\n    Eat or drink contaminated food or water. Lamb, pork and venison are especially likely to be infected with T. gondii. Occasionally, unpasteurized dairy products also may contain the parasite. Water contaminated with T. gondii isn't common in the United States.\n    Use contaminated knives, cutting boards or other utensils. Kitchen utensils that come into contact with raw meat can harbor the parasites unless the utensils are washed thoroughly in hot, soapy water.\n    Eat unwashed fruits and vegetables. The surface of fruits and vegetables may contain the parasite. To be safe, thoroughly wash and peel all produce, especially any you eat raw.\n    Receive an infected organ transplant or transfused blood. In rare cases, toxoplasmosis can be transmitted through an organ transplant or blood transfusion.\n\nWhen a person becomes infected with T. gondii, the parasite forms cysts that can affect almost any part of the body \u2014 often your brain and muscle tissue of different organs, including the heart.\nIf you're generally healthy, your immune system keeps the parasites in check. They remain in your body in an inactive state, providing you with lifelong immunity so that you can't become infected with the parasite again. But if your immune system is weakened by disease or certain medications, the infection can be reactivated, leading to serious complications.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Most pregnant women in the United States aren't routinely screened for toxoplasmosis, and most states don't screen infants for the infection.

In that case, you may have a negative result, even though you're infected. To be certain, your doctor may recommend retesting several weeks later.\nIn most cases, a negative toxoplasmosis test result means you've never been infected and therefore aren't immune to the disease. If you're at high risk, you can take certain precautions so that you don't become infected.\nA positive result could mean that you have an active infection, or it could mean that you were once infected and are immune to the disease.

Tests your doctor may recommend include:\n\n    Amniocentesis. In this procedure, which may be done safely after 15 weeks of pregnancy, your doctor uses a fine needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the fluid-filled sac that surrounds the fetus (amniotic sac). Tests are then performed on the fluid to check for evidence of toxoplasmosis. Amniocentesis carries a slight risk of miscarriage and minor complications, such as cramping, leaking fluid or irritation where the needle was inserted.\n    Ultrasound scan. This test uses sound waves to produce images of your baby in the womb. A detailed ultrasound can't diagnose toxoplasmosis. It can however, show whether your baby has certain signs, such as fluid buildup in the brain (hydrocephalus). However, a negative ultrasound doesn't rule out the possibility of infection. For that reason, your newborn will need an examination and follow-up blood tests during the first year of life.\n\n        \n            \n            Testing in severe casesIf you've developed a life-threatening illness such as encephalitis, you may need one or more imaging tests to check for lesions or cysts in your brain. These include:\n\n    \n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a magnetic field and radio (electromagnetic) waves to create cross-sectional images of your head and brain. During the procedure, you lie inside a large, doughnut-shaped machine that contains a magnet surrounded by coils that send and receive radio waves.\n    In response to the radio waves, your body produces faint signals that are picked up by the coils and processed into images by a computer. MRI is noninvasive and poses minimal risks to your health.\n    \n    Brain biopsy.

{"Diseases": "Transient ischemic attack (TIA)", "Symptoms": "Transient ischemic attacks usually last a few minutes. Most signs and symptoms disappear within an hour, though rarely symptoms may last up to 24 hours. The signs and symptoms of a TIA resemble those found early in a stroke and may include sudden onset of:\n\nWeakness, numbness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg, typically on one side of your body\nSlurred or garbled speech or difficulty understanding others\nBlindness in one or both eyes or double vision\nVertigo or loss of balance or coordination\n\nYou may have more than one TIA, and the recurrent signs and symptoms may be similar or different depending on which area of the brain is involved.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorSince TIAs most often occur hours or days before a stroke, seeking medical attention emergently following a possible TIA is essential. Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect you've had a transient ischemic attack.

In an ischemic stroke, a clot blocks the blood supply to part of your brain. In a transient ischemic attack, unlike a stroke, the blockage is brief, and there is no permanent damage.\nThe underlying cause of a TIA often is a buildup of cholesterol-containing fatty deposits called plaques (atherosclerosis) in an artery or one of its branches that supplies oxygen and nutrients to your brain.\nPlaques can decrease the blood flow through an artery or lead to the development of a clot. A blood clot moving to an artery that supplies your brain from another part of your body, most commonly from your heart, also may cause a TIA.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "A prompt evaluation of your symptoms is vital in diagnosing the cause of your TIA and deciding on a method of treatment. To help determine the cause of your TIA and to assess your risk of a stroke, your doctor may rely on the following:\n\n\nPhysical exam and tests. Your doctor will perform a physical exam and a neurological exam. The doctor will test your vision, eye movements, speech and language, strength, reflexes, and sensory system. Your doctor may use a stethoscope to listen to the carotid artery in your neck. A whooshing sound (bruit) may indicate atherosclerosis. Or your doctor may use an ophthalmoscope to look for cholesterol fragments or platelet fragments (emboli) in the tiny blood vessels of the retina at the back of your eye.\n\nYour doctor may check for risk factors of a stroke, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, diabetes and in some cases high levels of the amino acid homocysteine.\n\nCarotid ultrasonography. If your doctor suspects that the carotid artery may be the cause of your TIA, a carotid ultrasound may be considered. A wand-like device (transducer) sends high-frequency sound waves into your neck. After the sound waves pass through your tissue and back, your doctor can analyze images on a screen to look for narrowing or clotting in the carotid arteries.\nComputerized tomography (CT) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) scanning. CT scanning of your head uses X-ray beams to assemble a composite 3D look at your brain or evaluate the arteries in your neck and brain. CTA scanning uses X-rays similar to a standard CT scan but may also involve injection of a contrast material into a blood vessel. Unlike a carotid ultrasound, a CTA scan can evaluate blood vessels in the neck and head.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). These procedures, which use a strong magnetic field, can generate a composite 3D view of your brain. MRA uses technology similar to MRI to evaluate the arteries in your neck and brain but may include an injection of a contrast material into a blood vessel.\nEchocardiography. Your doctor may choose to perform a traditional echocardiography called transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). A TTE involves moving an instrument called a transducer across your chest. The transducer emits sound waves that bounce off different parts of your heart, creating an ultrasound image.\n\nOr your doctor may choose to perform another type of echocardiography called a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). During a TEE, a flexible probe with a transducer built into it is placed in your esophagus \u2014 the tube that connects the back of your mouth to your stomach. Because your esophagus is directly behind your heart, clearer, detailed ultrasound images can be created. This allows a better view of some things, such as blood clots, that might not be seen clearly in a traditional echocardiography exam.\n\nArteriography. This procedure gives a view of arteries in your brain not normally seen in X-ray imaging. A radiologist inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through a small incision, usually in your groin.\nThe catheter is manipulated through your major arteries and into your carotid or vertebral artery. Then the radiologist injects a dye through the catheter to provide X-ray images of the arteries in your brain. This procedure may be used in selected cases.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Transient ischemic attack (TIA)-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationTransient ischemic attack (TIA) care at Mayo ClinicBlood pressure testCarotid ultrasoundCholesterol testCT coronary angiogramCT scanEchocardiogramMRIShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Once your doctor has determined the cause of your transient ischemic attack, the goal of treatment is to correct the abnormality and prevent a stroke. Depending on the cause of your TIA, your doctor may prescribe medication to reduce the tendency for blood to clot or may recommend surgery or a balloon procedure (angioplasty).\n        \n            \n            MedicationsDoctors use several medications to decrease the likelihood of a stroke after a transient ischemic attack. The medication selected depends on the location, cause, severity and type of TIA. Your doctor may prescribe:\n\n\nAnti-platelet drugs. These medications make your platelets, one of the circulating blood cell types, less likely to stick together. When blood vessels are injured, sticky platelets begin to form clots, a process completed by clotting proteins in blood plasma.\nThe most frequently used anti-platelet medication is aspirin. Aspirin is also the least expensive treatment with the fewest potential side effects. An alternative to aspirin is the anti-platelet drug clopidogrel (Plavix).\nYour doctor might prescribe aspirin and clopidogrel to be taken together for about a month after the TIA. Research shows that taking these two drugs together in certain situations reduces the risk of a future stroke more than taking aspirin alone. There may be certain situations when the duration of taking both medications together may be extended, such as when the cause of the TIA is a narrowing of a blood vessel located in the head.\nYour doctor may consider prescribing Aggrenox, a combination of low-dose aspirin and the anti-platelet drug dipyridamole, to reduce blood clotting. The way dipyridamole works is slightly different from aspirin.\n\nAnticoagulants. These drugs include heparin and warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven). They affect clotting-system proteins instead of platelet function. Heparin is used for a short time and is rarely used in the management of TIAs.\nThese drugs require careful monitoring. If atrial fibrillation is present, your doctor may prescribe a direct oral anticoagulant such as apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), edoxaban (Savaysa) or dabigatran (Pradaxa).\n\n\n        \n            \n            Surgery\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Carotid endarterectomy\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCarotid endarterectomy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCarotid endarterectomy\n\t\t\t\tIn carotid endarterectomy, your surgeon opens the carotid artery to remove atherosclerotic plaques.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a moderately or severely narrowed neck (carotid) artery, your doctor may suggest carotid endarterectomy (end-ahr-tur-EK-tuh-me). This preventive surgery clears carotid arteries of fatty deposits (atherosclerotic plaques) before another TIA or stroke can occur. An incision is made to open the artery, the plaques are removed, and the artery is closed.\n        \n            \n            AngioplastyIn selected cases, a procedure called carotid angioplasty, or stenting, is an option. This procedure involves using a balloon-like device to open a clogged artery and placing a small wire tube (stent) into the artery to keep it open.More InformationTransient ischemic attack (TIA) care at Mayo ClinicCarotid endarterectomy Coronary angioplasty and stents\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

An overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue is sometimes referred to as a thyroid adenoma. It's unclear why this occurs, but it's not cancerous and isn't considered serious unless it causes bothersome symptoms from its size.\n    Some thyroid adenomas lead to hyperthyroidism.\n    \n    Thyroid cyst. Fluid-filled cavities (cysts) in the thyroid most commonly result from degenerating thyroid adenomas. Often, solid components are mixed with fluid in thyroid cysts. Cysts are usually noncancerous, but they occasionally contain cancerous solid components.\n    Chronic inflammation of the thyroid. Hashimoto's disease, a thyroid disorder, can cause thyroid inflammation and result in enlarged nodules. This often is associated with hypothyroidism.\n    Multinodular goiter. The term goiter is used to describe any enlargement of the thyroid gland, which can be caused by iodine deficiency or a thyroid disorder. A multinodular goiter contains multiple distinct nodules within the goiter, but its cause is less clear.\n    \n    Thyroid cancer. The chances that a nodule is cancerous are small. However, a nodule that is large and hard or causes pain or discomfort is more worrisome. You will likely want to have it checked by your doctor.\n    Certain factors increase your risk of thyroid cancer, such as a family history of thyroid or other endocrine cancers and having a history of radiation exposure from medical therapy or from nuclear fallout.\n    \n    Iodine deficiency. Lack of iodine in your diet can sometimes cause your thyroid gland to develop thyroid nodules. But iodine deficiency is uncommon in the United States, where iodine is routinely added to table salt and other foods.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "In assessing a lump or nodule in your neck, one of your doctor's main goals is to rule out the possibility of cancer. But your doctor will also want to know if your thyroid is functioning properly. Tests include:\n\n    \n    Physical exam. Your doctor will likely ask you to swallow while he or she examines your thyroid because a nodule in your thyroid gland will usually move up and down during swallowing.\n    Your doctor will also look for signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremor, overly active reflexes, and a rapid or irregular heartbeat. He or she will also check for signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as a slow heartbeat, dry skin and facial swelling.\n    \n    Thyroid function tests. Tests that measure blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and hormones produced by your thyroid gland can indicate whether you have hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.\n    Ultrasound. This imaging technique uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of your thyroid gland. A thyroid ultrasound provides the best information about the shape and structure of nodules. Doctors may use it to distinguish cysts from solid nodules or to determine if multiple nodules are present. Doctors may also use it as a guide in performing a fine-needle aspiration biopsy.\n    \n    Fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Nodules are often biopsied to make sure no cancer is present. During the procedure, your doctor inserts a very thin needle in the nodule and removes a sample of cells.\n    The procedure is usually done in your doctor's office, takes about 20 minutes and has few risks. Often, your doctor will use ultrasound to help guide the placement of the needle. Your doctor then sends the samples to a laboratory to have them analyzed under a microscope.\n    \n    \n    Thyroid scan. Your doctor may recommend a thyroid scan to help evaluate thyroid nodules. During this test, an isotope of radioactive iodine is injected into a vein in your arm. You then lie on a table while a special camera produces an image of your thyroid on a computer screen.\n    Nodules that produce excess thyroid hormone \u2014 called hot nodules \u2014 show up on the scan because they take up more of the isotope than normal thyroid tissue does. Hot nodules are almost always noncancerous.\n    In some cases, nodules that take up less of the isotope \u2014 called cold nodules \u2014 are cancerous. However, a thyroid scan can't distinguish between cold nodules that are cancerous and those that aren't cancerous.\n    \nMore InformationNeedle biopsyUltrasound\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the type of thyroid nodule you have.\n        \n            \n            Treating benign nodulesIf a thyroid nodule isn't cancerous, treatment options include:\n\n    \n    Watchful waiting. If a biopsy shows that you have a noncancerous thyroid nodule, your doctor may suggest simply watching your condition.\n    This usually means having a physical exam and thyroid function tests at regular intervals. It may also include an ultrasound. You're also likely to have another biopsy if the nodule grows larger. If a benign thyroid nodule remains unchanged, you may never need treatment.\n    \n    Thyroid hormone therapy. If your thyroid function test finds your gland isn't producing enough thyroid hormone, your doctor may recommend thyroid hormone therapy.\n    Surgery. A noncancerous nodule may sometimes require surgery if it's so large that it makes it hard to breathe or swallow. Doctors may also consider surgery for people with large multinodular goiters, particularly when the goiters constrict airways, the esophagus or blood vessels. Nodules diagnosed as indeterminate or suspicious by a biopsy also need surgical removal, so they can be examined for signs of cancer.\n\n        \n            \n            Treating nodules that cause hyperthyroidismIf a thyroid nodule is producing thyroid hormones, overloading your thyroid gland's normal hormone production levels, your doctor may recommend treating you for hyperthyroidism. This may include:\n\n    Radioactive iodine. Doctors use radioactive iodine to treat hyperthyroidism. Taken as a capsule or in liquid form, radioactive iodine is absorbed by your thyroid gland. This causes the nodules to shrink and signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism to subside, usually within two to three months.\n    Anti-thyroid medications. In some cases, your doctor may recommend an anti-thyroid medication such as methimazole (Tapazole) to reduce symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Treatment is generally long term and can have serious side effects on your liver, so it's important to discuss the treatment's risks and benefits with your doctor.\n    Surgery. If treatment with radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications isn't an option, you may be a candidate for surgery to remove the overactive thyroid nodule. You'll likely discuss the risks of surgery with your doctor.\n\n        \n            \n            Treating cancerous nodulesTreatment for a nodule that's cancerous usually involves surgery.\n\n    Observation. Very small cancers have a low risk of growing, so it may be appropriate for your doctor to closely watch cancerous nodules before treating them. This decision is often made with the help of a thyroid specialist. Observation includes ultrasound monitoring and performing blood tests.\n    \n    Surgery. A common treatment for cancerous nodules is surgical removal. In the past, it was standard to remove a majority of thyroid tissue \u2014 a procedure called near-total thyroidectomy. However, today more limited surgery to remove only half of the thyroid may be appropriate for some cancerous nodules. Near-total thyroidectomy may be used depending on the extent of the disease.\n    Risks of thyroid surgery include damage to the nerve that controls your vocal cords and damage to your parathyroid glands \u2014 four tiny glands located on the back of your thyroid that help control your body's levels of minerals, such as calcium.\n    After a thyroid surgery, you'll need lifelong treatment with levothyroxine to supply your body with thyroid hormone. Your thyroid specialist will help determine the correct amount to take because it may require more than hormone replacement to manage your cancer risk.\n    \n    Alcohol ablation. Another option for management of certain small cancerous nodules is alcohol ablation. This technique involves injecting a small amount of alcohol in the cancerous thyroid nodule to destroy it. Multiple treatment sessions are often required.\nMore InformationThyroidectomy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Because each platelet lives only about 10 days, your body normally renews your platelet supply continually by producing new platelets in your bone marrow.\nThrombocytopenia rarely is inherited; or it can be caused by a number of medications or conditions. Whatever the cause, circulating platelets are reduced by one or more of the following processes: trapping of platelets in the spleen, decreased platelet production or increased destruction of platelets.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Trapped plateletsThe spleen is a small organ about the size of your fist situated just below your rib cage on the left side of your abdomen. Normally, your spleen works to fight infection and filter unwanted material from your blood.

This most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome is characterized by compression of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that come from your spinal cord and control muscle movements and sensation in your shoulder, arm and hand. \n    Vascular thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins (venous thoracic outlet syndrome) or arteries (arterial thoracic outlet syndrome) under the collarbone (clavicle) are compressed.\n    Nonspecific-type thoracic outlet syndrome. This type is also called disputed thoracic outlet syndrome. Some doctors don't believe it exists, while others say it's a common disorder. People with nonspecific-type thoracic outlet syndrome have chronic pain in the area of the thoracic outlet that worsens with activity, but a specific cause of the pain can't be determined.\n\nThoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary, depending on which structures are compressed. When nerves are compressed, signs and symptoms of neurological thoracic outlet syndrome include:\n\n    Muscle wasting in the fleshy base of your thumb (Gilliatt-Sumner hand)\n    Numbness or tingling in your arm or fingers\n    Pain or aches in your neck, shoulder or hand\n    Weakening grip\n\nSigns and symptoms of vascular thoracic outlet syndrome can include:\n\n    Discoloration of your hand (bluish color)\n    Arm pain and swelling, possibly due to blood clots\n    Blood clot in veins or arteries in the upper area of your body\n    Lack of color (pallor) in one or more of your fingers or your entire hand\n    Weak or no pulse in the affected arm\n    Cold fingers, hands or arms\n    Arm fatigue with activity\n    Numbness or tingling in your fingers\n    Weakness of arm or neck\n    Throbbing lump near your collarbone\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your doctor if you consistently experience any of the signs and symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "In general, the cause of thoracic outlet syndrome is compression of the nerves or blood vessels in the thoracic outlet, just under your collarbone (clavicle). The cause of the compression varies and can include:\n\n    Anatomical defects. Inherited defects that are present at birth (congenital) may include an extra rib located above the first rib (cervical rib) or an abnormally tight fibrous band connecting your spine to your rib.\n    Poor posture. Drooping your shoulders or holding your head in a forward position can cause compression in the thoracic outlet area.\n    Trauma. A traumatic event, such as a car accident, can cause internal changes that then compress the nerves in the thoracic outlet. The onset of symptoms related to a traumatic accident often is delayed.\n    Repetitive activity. Doing the same thing repeatedly can, over time, wear on your body's tissue. You may notice symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome if your job requires you to repeat a movement continuously, such as typing on a computer, working on an assembly line or lifting things above your head, as you would if you were stocking shelves. Athletes, such as baseball pitchers and swimmers, also can develop thoracic outlet syndrome from years of repetitive movements.\n    Pressure on your joints. Obesity can put an undue amount of stress on your joints, as can carrying around an oversized bag or backpack.\n    Pregnancy. Because joints loosen during pregnancy, signs of thoracic outlet syndrome may first appear while you're pregnant.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing thoracic outlet syndrome can be difficult because the symptoms and their severity can vary greatly among people with the disorder.

Your doctor will check your symptoms and examine you in different positions.\n        \n            \n            Imaging and nerve study testsTo confirm the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome, your doctor may order one or more of the following tests:\n\n    X-ray. Your doctor may order an X-ray of the affected area, which may reveal an extra rib (cervical rib). X-rays may also rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms.\n    Ultrasound. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of your body. Doctors may use this test to see if you have vascular thoracic outlet syndrome or other vascular problems.\n    Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your body. A dye may be injected into a vein to view the blood vessels in greater detail (CT angiography). A CT scan may identify the location and cause of blood vessel (vascular) compression.\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful radio waves and magnets to create a detailed view of your body. Your doctor may use an MRI to determine the location and cause of blood vessel (vascular) compression. An MRI may reveal congenital anomalies, such as a fibrous band connecting your spine to your rib or a cervical rib, which may be the cause of your symptoms.\n    Angiography. In some cases, you may be given an intravenous dye before a CT or MRI scan. The dye helps to make blood vessels more visible on the images.\n    \n    Arteriography and venography. In these tests, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through a small incision, usually in your groin. The catheter is moved through your major arteries in arteriography, or through your veins in venography, to the affected blood vessels. Then your doctor injects a dye through the catheter to show X-ray images of your arteries or veins.\n    Doctors can check to see if you have a compressed vein or artery. If a vein or artery has a clot, doctors can deliver medications through the catheter to dissolve the clot.\n    \n    Electromyography (EMG). During an EMG, your doctor inserts a needle electrode through your skin into various muscles. The test evaluates the electrical activity of your muscles when they contract and when they're at rest.\n    Nerve conduction study.

These exercises, done over time, may take the pressure off your blood vessels and nerves in the thoracic outlet.\n    Medications. Your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory medications, pain medications or muscle relaxants to decrease inflammation, reduce pain and encourage muscle relaxation.\n    Clot-dissolving medications. If you have venous or arterial thoracic outlet syndrome and have blood clots, your doctor may administer clot-dissolving medications (thrombolytics) into your veins or arteries to dissolve blood clots.

Also, surgery may not relieve your symptoms, and symptoms may recur.\nSurgery to treat thoracic outlet syndrome, called thoracic outlet decompression, may be performed using several different approaches, including:\n\n    Transaxillary approach. In this surgery, your surgeon makes an incision in your chest to access the first rib, divide the muscles in front of the rib and remove a portion of the first rib to relieve compression. This approach gives your surgeon easy access to the first rib without disturbing the nerves or blood vessels. But, that only gives your surgeon limited access and makes it harder to see muscles and cervical ribs that may be contributing to compression behind the nerves and blood vessels.\n    \n    Supraclavicular approach. This approach repairs compressed blood vessels. Your surgeon makes an incision just under your neck to expose your brachial plexus region.\n    Your surgeon then looks for signs of trauma or muscles contributing to compression near your first (uppermost) rib. Your surgeon may remove the muscles causing the compression and repair compressed blood vessels. Your first rib may be removed if necessary to relieve compression.\n    \n    Infraclavicular approach. In this approach, your surgeon makes an incision under your collarbone and across your chest. This procedure may be used to treat compressed veins that require extensive repair.\n\nIn venous or arterial thoracic outlet syndrome, your surgeon may deliver medications to dissolve blood clots prior to thoracic outlet compression. Also, in some cases, your surgeon may conduct a procedure to remove a clot from the vein or artery or repair the vein or artery prior to thoracic outlet decompression.\nIf you have arterial thoracic outlet syndrome, your surgeon may need to replace the damaged artery with a section of an artery from another part of your body (graft) or an artificial graft.

{"Diseases": "Tuberculosis", "Symptoms": "Although your body can harbor the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, your immune system usually can prevent you from becoming sick. For this reason, doctors make a distinction between:\n\n    Latent TB. You have a TB infection, but the bacteria in your body are inactive and cause no symptoms. Latent TB, also called inactive TB or TB infection, isn't contagious. Latent TB can turn into active TB, so treatment is important.\n    Active TB. Also called TB disease, this condition makes you sick and, in most cases, can spread to others. It can occur weeks or years after infection with the TB bacteria.\n\nSigns and symptoms of active TB include:\n\n    Coughing for three or more weeks\n    Coughing up blood or mucus\n    Chest pain, or pain with breathing or coughing\n    Unintentional weight loss\n    Fatigue\n    Fever\n    Night sweats\n    Chills\n    Loss of appetite\n\nTuberculosis can also affect other parts of your body, including the kidneys, spine or brain. When TB occurs outside your lungs, signs and symptoms vary according to the organs involved. For example, tuberculosis of the spine might cause back pain, and tuberculosis in your kidneys might cause blood in your urine.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorSee your doctor if you have a fever, unexplained weight loss, drenching night sweats or a persistent cough. These are often indications of TB but can also result from other conditions. Also, see your doctor if you think you've been exposed to TB.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have an increased risk of tuberculosis be screened for latent TB infection. This recommendation includes people who:\n\n    Have HIV/AIDS\n    Use IV drugs\n    Are in contact with infected people\n    Are from a country where TB is common, such as several countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia\n    Live or work in areas where TB is common, such as prisons or nursing homes\n    Work in health care and treat people with a high risk of TB\n    Are children who are exposed to adults at risk of TB\n\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that spread from person to person through microscopic droplets released into the air. This can happen when someone with the untreated, active form of tuberculosis coughs, speaks, sneezes, spits, laughs or sings.\nAlthough tuberculosis is contagious, it's not easy to catch. You're much more likely to get tuberculosis from someone you live or work with than from a stranger. Most people with active TB who've had appropriate drug treatment for at least two weeks are no longer contagious.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            HIV and TBSince the 1980s, tuberculosis cases have increased dramatically because of the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. HIV suppresses the immune system, making it difficult for the body to control TB bacteria. As a result, people with HIV are much more likely to get TB and to progress from latent to active disease than are people who aren't HIV positive.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Drug-resistant TBTuberculosis also remains a major killer because of the increase in drug-resistant strains. Over time, some TB germs have developed the ability to survive despite medications. This is partly because people don't take their drugs as directed or don't complete the course of treatment.\nDrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis emerge when an antibiotic fails to kill all of the bacteria it targets. The surviving bacteria become resistant to that drug and often other antibiotics as well. Some TB bacteria have developed resistance to the most commonly used treatments, such as isoniazid and rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane).\nSome TB strains have also developed resistance to drugs less commonly used in TB treatment, such as the antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones, and injectable medications including amikacin and capreomycin (Capastat). These medications are often used to treat infections that are resistant to the more commonly used drugs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During the physical exam, your doctor will check your lymph nodes for swelling and use a stethoscope to listen to the sounds your lungs make when you breathe.\nThe most commonly used diagnostic tool for tuberculosis is a skin test, though blood tests are becoming more commonplace. A small amount of a substance called tuberculin is injected just below the skin on the inside of your forearm. You should feel only a slight needle prick.\nWithin 48 to 72 hours, a health care professional will check your arm for swelling at the injection site. A hard, raised red bump means you're likely to have TB infection. The size of the bump determines whether the test results are significant.\n        \n            \n            Results can be wrongThe TB skin test isn't perfect. Sometimes, it suggests that people have TB when they don't. It can also indicate that people don't have TB when they do.\nYou can have a false-positive result if you've been vaccinated recently with the bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. This tuberculosis vaccine is seldom used in the United States but is widely used in countries with high TB infection rates.\nFalse-negative results also can occur.\n        \n            \n            Blood testsBlood tests can confirm or rule out latent or active tuberculosis. These tests measure your immune system's reaction to TB bacteria.\nThese tests require only one office visit.

A laboratory uses microscopic identification techniques to check for eggs or tapeworm segments in your feces.\n\nBecause the eggs and segments are passed irregularly, the lab may need to collect two to three samples over a period of time to detect the parasite. Eggs are sometimes present at the anus, so your doctor may use a piece of transparent adhesive tape pressed to the anus to collect eggs for microscopic identification.\n\nBlood test. For tissue-invasive infections, your doctor may also test your blood for antibodies your body may have produced to fight tapeworm infection. The presence of these antibodies indicates tapeworm infestation.\nImaging exam.

However, if you're diagnosed with intestinal tapeworm infection, medication will likely be prescribed to get rid of it.\n        \n            \n            Treatments for intestinal infectionsThe most common treatment for tapeworm infection involves oral medications that are toxic to the adult tapeworm, including:\n\n\nPraziquantel (Biltricide)\nAlbendazole (Albenza)\nNitazoxanide (Alinia)\n\n\nWhich medication your doctor prescribes depends on the species of tapeworm involved and the site of the infection. These drugs target the adult tapeworm, not the eggs, so it's important to avoid reinfecting yourself. Always wash your hands after using the toilet and before eating.\n\nTo be certain that your tapeworm infection has cleared, your doctor will probably have your stool samples checked at certain intervals after you've finished taking your medication. Successful treatment \u2014 meaning that your stool is free of tapeworm eggs, larvae or proglottids \u2014 is most likely if you receive appropriate treatment for the type of tapeworm causing your infection.\n        \n            \n            Treatments for invasive infectionsTreating an invasive infection depends on the location and effects of the infection.\n\n\nAnthelmintic drugs.

Your doctor may monitor the cysts periodically using imaging studies such as ultrasound or X-ray to be sure the drug is effective.\nAnti-inflammatory therapy. Dying tapeworm cysts can cause swelling or inflammation in tissues or organs, so your doctor may recommend prescription corticosteroid medication, such as prednisone or dexamethasone, to reduce inflammation.\nAnti-epileptic therapy. If the disease is causing seizures, anti-epileptic medications can stop them.\nShunt placement. One type of invasive infection can cause too much fluid on the brain, called hydrocephalus. Your doctor may recommend placing a permanent tube (shunt) in your head to drain the fluid.\nSurgery. Whether cysts can be removed surgically depends on their location and symptoms.

Pregnant women are not immune to syphilis. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or infant deaths. That's why all pregnant women should be screened. Syphilis is preventable and treatable. As for prevention, Dr. Rizza recommends barrier protection during sex.\n\nDr. Rizza: And that's during oral sex, anal sex, vaginal sex \u2014 using condoms, dental dams and any other barrier protection.\n\nVivien Williams: For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Vivien Williams.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMore InformationMayo Clinic Minute: Signs and symptoms of syphilis\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The cause of syphilis is a bacterium called Treponema pallidum. The most common route of transmission is through contact with an infected person's sore during sexual activity. The bacteria enter your body through minor cuts or abrasions in your skin or mucous membranes. Syphilis is contagious during its primary and secondary stages, and sometimes in the early latent period.\nLess commonly, syphilis may spread through direct unprotected close contact with an active lesion (such as during kissing) or through infected mothers to their babies during pregnancy or childbirth (congenital syphilis).\nSyphilis can't be spread by using the same toilet, bathtub, clothing or eating utensils, or from doorknobs, swimming pools or hot tubs.\nOnce cured, syphilis doesn't recur on its own.

The antibodies to the syphilis-causing bacteria remain in your body for years, so the test can be used to determine a current or past infection.\n    Cerebrospinal fluid. If it's suspected that you have nervous system complications of syphilis, your doctor may also suggest collecting a sample of cerebrospinal fluid through a procedure called a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). \n\nThrough the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, your local health department offers partner services, which will help you notify your sexual partners that they may be infected.

The preferred treatment at all stages is penicillin, an antibiotic medication that can kill the organism that causes syphilis. If you're allergic to penicillin, your doctor may suggest another antibiotic or recommend penicillin desensitization.\nIf you are diagnosed with primary, secondary or early-stage latent syphilis (by definition, less than a year), the recommended treatment is a single injection of penicillin. If you've had syphilis for longer than a year, you may need additional doses.\nPenicillin is the only recommended treatment for pregnant women with syphilis. Women who are allergic to penicillin can undergo a desensitization process that may allow them to take penicillin. Even if you're treated for syphilis during your pregnancy, your newborn child should be tested for congenital syphilis and if infected, receive antibiotic treatment.\nThe first day you receive treatment you may experience what's known as the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. Signs and symptoms include a fever, chills, nausea, achy pain and a headache. This reaction usually doesn't last more than one day.\n        \n            \n            Treatment follow-upAfter you're treated for syphilis, your doctor will ask you to:\n\n    Have periodic blood tests and exams to make sure you're responding to the usual dosage of penicillin. Your specific follow-up will depend on the stage of syphilis you're diagnosed with.\n    Avoid sexual contact with new partners until the treatment is completed and blood tests indicate the infection has been cured.\n    Notify your sex partners so that they can be tested and get treatment if necessary.\n    Be tested for HIV infection.\n\n        \n            \n    "},

It occurs when faulty electrical connections in the heart set off a series of early beats in the upper chambers of the heart (atria).\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSVT starts above the heart's ventricles (supraventricular) in the two upper chambers or a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. To understand how this occurs, it can be helpful to understand how the heart beats.\nYour heart is made up of four chambers \u2014 two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).\nThe rhythm of your heart is normally controlled by a natural pacemaker (the sinus node) in the right upper chamber (atrium). The sinus node sends out electrical signals that normally start each heartbeat. These electrical signals move across the atria, causing the heart muscles to squeeze and pump blood into the ventricles.\nNext, the signals arrive at the AV node. The AV node slows down the electrical signals. This slight delay allows the lower heart chambers to fill with blood. When the electrical signals finally get to the muscles of the ventricles, the lower heart chambers squeeze (contract), which pumps blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body.\nIn a healthy heart, this heart signaling process usually goes smoothly, resulting in a normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            SVT occurs when faulty electrical connections in the heart set off a series of early beats in the atria. When this happens, the heart rate becomes so fast so quickly, the heart doesn't have enough time to fill with blood before the chambers contract. As a result, you may feel light-headed or dizzy because your brain isn't getting enough blood and oxygen.\nSupraventricular tachycardia falls into three main groups:\n\n    Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). This is the most common type of supraventricular tachycardia in both males and females of any age, although it tends to occur more often in young women.\n    Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). AVRT is the second most-common type of supraventricular tachycardia. It's most commonly diagnosed in younger people.\n    Atrial tachycardia. This type of SVT is more commonly diagnosed in people who have heart disease. Atrial tachycardia doesn't involve the AV node.\n\nOther types of supraventricular tachycardia include:\n\n    Sinus tachycardia\n    Sinus nodal reentrant tachycardia (SNRT)\n    Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST)\n    Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)\n    Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET)\n    Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia (NPJT)\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To diagnose supraventricular tachycardia, your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and your medical history and perform a physical exam. Blood tests are usually done to check for other health conditions that could cause your symptoms, such as thyroid disease.\nYour doctor may also order several tests to check your heart health. Tests to diagnosis SVT include:\n\n    Electrocardiogram (ECG). During an ECG, sensors (electrodes) that can detect the electrical activity of your heart are attached to your chest and sometimes to your limbs. An ECG measures the timing and duration of each electrical phase in your heartbeat.\n    Holter monitor. This portable ECG device can be worn for a day or more to record your heart's activity as you go about your routine.\n    Event monitor or mobile telemetry device. For sporadic episodes of SVT, you may be asked to wear an ECG device for a longer period of time (up to 30 days or until you have an SVT episode or arrhythmia or typical symptoms).\n    Echocardiogram. In this noninvasive test, a hand-held device (transducer) placed on your chest uses sound waves to produce images of your heart's size, structure and motion.\n    Implantable loop recorder. This device detects abnormal heart rhythms and is implanted under the skin in the chest area.\n\nIf your doctor doesn't find a heart rhythm problem during those tests, you may need other tests, such as:\n\n    Stress test. For some people, supraventricular tachycardia is triggered or worsened by stress or exercise. During a stress test, you'll be asked to exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle while your heart activity is monitored. If you can't exercise and your doctor thinks heart disease may be causing your arrhythmia, you may receive a drug to stimulate your heart in a way that's similar to exercise.\n    Tilt table test. Your doctor may recommend this test if you've had fainting spells. Your heart rate and blood pressure are monitored as you lie flat on a table. The table is then tilted as if you were standing up. Your doctor observes how your heart and the nervous system that controls it respond to the change in angle.\n    \n    Electrophysiological testing and mapping. In this test, doctors thread thin tubes (catheters) tipped with electrodes through your blood vessels to several areas within your heart. Once in place, the electrodes can map the spread of electrical signals through your heart.\n    In addition, your cardiologist can use the electrodes to stimulate your heart to beat at rates that may trigger \u2014 or stop \u2014 the arrhythmia. This test allows your doctor to see the location of the arrhythmia and what may be causing it.\n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your supraventricular tachycardia-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationSupraventricular tachycardia care at Mayo ClinicEP study\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Most people with supraventricular tachycardia do not require medical treatment. However, if you have long or frequent episodes, your doctor may recommend the following:\n\n    Carotid sinus massage. A doctor applies gentle pressure on the neck where the carotid artery splits into two branches. During this type of massage, the body releases chemicals that slow the heart rate. Don't attempt to do this on your own.\n    Vagal maneuvers. You may be able to stop an episode of SVT by using particular movements such as holding your breath and straining as you would during a bowel movement, dunking your face in ice water, or coughing. These maneuvers affect the nervous system that controls your heartbeat (vagus nerves), often causing your heart rate to slow.\n    \n    Cardioversion. If you're unable to stop an episode of SVT on your own using vagal maneuvers, your doctor may use cardioversion. Cardioversion may be done using medications or during a heart procedure.\n    In the procedure, a shock is delivered to your heart through paddles or patches on your chest. The current affects the electrical signals in your heart and can restore a normal rhythm.\n    \n    Medications. If you have frequent episodes of SVT, your doctor may prescribe medication to control your heart rate or restore a normal heart rhythm. It's very important to take the medication exactly as directed by your doctor in order to reduce complications.\n    Catheter ablation. In this procedure, the doctor inserts thin, flexible tubes called catheters through the veins or arteries, usually in the groin. Sensors on the tip of the catheter use heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in your heart to block abnormal electrical signals and restore a normal heartbeat.\n    Pacemaker. Rarely, a small, implantable device called a pacemaker is used to stimulate your heart to beat at a normal rate.

Normally, valve-like muscles in the urethra \u2014 the short tube that carries urine out of your body \u2014 stay closed as the bladder expands, preventing urine leakage until you reach a bathroom. But when those muscles weaken, anything that exerts force on the abdominal and pelvic muscles \u2014 sneezing, bending over, lifting or laughing hard, for instance \u2014 can put pressure on your bladder and cause urine leakage.\nYour pelvic floor muscles and urinary sphincter may lose strength because of:\n\n    Childbirth. In women, tissue or nerve damage during delivery of a child can weaken the pelvic floor muscles or the sphincter. Stress incontinence from this damage may begin soon after delivery or occur years later.\n    Prostate surgery. In men, the surgical removal of the prostate gland to treat prostate cancer (prostatectomy) is the most common factor leading to stress incontinence. This procedure can weaken the sphincter, which lies directly below the prostate gland and encircles the urethra.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Contributing factorsOther factors that may worsen stress incontinence include:\n\n    Illnesses that cause chronic coughing\n    Obesity\n    Smoking, which can cause frequent coughing\n    High-impact activities, such as running and jumping, over many years\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During your visit, your doctor looks for clues that may indicate contributing factors.

However, in some cases, your doctor might order tests to assess how well your bladder, urethra and sphincter are functioning (urodynamic tests).\nBladder function tests may include:\n\n    \n    Measurements of post-void residual urine. Your doctor may recommend this test if there's concern about your ability to empty your bladder completely, particularly if you are older, have had prior bladder surgery or have diabetes. This test can tell how well your bladder is functioning.\n    \n    A specialist uses an ultrasound scan, which translates sound waves into an image, to view how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. In some cases, a thin tube (catheter) is passed through the urethra and into your bladder. The catheter drains the remaining urine, which can then be measured.\n    \n    \n    Measuring bladder pressures. Cystometry is a test that measures pressure in your bladder and in the surrounding region as your bladder fills. Your doctor may recommend this test to check for stress incontinence if you have had a neurologic disease of the spinal cord.\n    A catheter is used to fill your bladder slowly with warm fluid. As your bladder fills, you may be asked to cough or bear down to test for leaks. This procedure may be combined with a pressure-flow study, which tells how much pressure your bladder has to exert in order to empty completely.\n    \n    Creating images of the bladder as it functions. Video urodynamics is a test that uses imaging to create pictures of your bladder as it's filling and emptying. Warm fluid mixed with a dye that shows up on X-rays is gradually instilled in your bladder by a catheter while the images are recorded. When your bladder is full, the imaging continues as you urinate to empty your bladder.\n    Cystoscopy. This test uses a scope that is inserted into the bladder to look for blockages or any abnormalities in the bladder and urethra. This procedure is usually completed in the office.\n\nYou and your doctor should discuss the results of any tests and decide how they impact your treatment strategy.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your stress incontinence-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationStress incontinence care at Mayo ClinicUrinalysis\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Your doctor may recommend a combination of strategies to treat incontinence.

The treatments your doctor recommends may include:\n\n    \n    Pelvic floor muscle exercises. Your doctor or physical therapist can help you learn how to do Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and urinary sphincter. Just like any other exercise routine, how well Kegel exercises work for you depends on whether you perform them regularly.\n    A technique called biofeedback can be used along with Kegel exercises to make them more effective. Biofeedback involves the use of pressure sensors or electrical stimulation to reinforce the proper muscle contractions.\n    \n    \n    Fluid consumption. Your doctor may recommend how much and when you should consume fluids during the day and evening. However, don't limit what you drink so much that you become dehydrated.\n    Your doctor may also suggest that you avoid caffeinated, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, which may irritate and affect bladder function in some people. If you find that using fluid schedules and avoiding certain beverages significantly improve leakage, you'll have to decide whether making these changes in your diet are worth it.\n    \n    Healthy lifestyle changes. Quitting smoking, losing excess weight or treating a chronic cough will lessen your risk of stress incontinence and improve your symptoms.\n    Bladder training. Your doctor might recommend a schedule for toileting if you have mixed incontinence. More frequent voiding of the bladder may reduce the number or severity of urge incontinence episodes.\n\n        \n            \n            MedicationsThere are no approved medications to specifically treat stress incontinence in the United States. The antidepressant duloxetine (Cymbalta, Drizalma Sprinkle) is used for the treatment of stress incontinence in Europe, however.\nSymptoms quickly return when the drug is stopped. Nausea is the most common side effect that makes people stop taking the medication.\n        \n            \n            DevicesCertain devices designed for women may help control stress incontinence, including:\n\n    \n    Vaginal pessary. A specialized urinary incontinence pessary, shaped like a ring with two bumps that sit on each side of the urethra, is fitted and put into place by your doctor or nurse. It helps support your bladder base to prevent urine leakage during activity, especially if your bladder has dropped (prolapsed).\n    This is a good choice if you wish to avoid surgery. A pessary will require routine removal and cleaning. Pessaries are used mostly in people who also have pelvic organ prolapse.\n    \n    \n    Urethral inserts. This small tampon-like disposable device inserted into the urethra acts as a barrier to prevent leakage. It's usually used to prevent incontinence during a specific activity, but it may be worn throughout the day.\n    Urethral inserts can be worn for up to eight hours a day. Urethral inserts are generally used only for heavy activity, such as repeated lifting, running or playing tennis.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Surgery\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Bladder neck suspension\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBladder neck suspension\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBladder neck suspension\n\t\t\t\tBladder neck suspension adds support to the bladder neck and urethra, reducing the risk of stress incontinence.

Both are designed to reduce or eliminate stress incontinence in women.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nSurgical interventions to treat stress incontinence are designed to improve closure of the sphincter or support the bladder neck. Surgical options include:\n\n    \n    Sling procedure. This is the most common procedure performed in women with stress urinary incontinence. In this procedure, the surgeon uses the person's own tissue, synthetic material (mesh), or animal or donor tissue to create a sling or hammock that supports the urethra.\n    Slings are also used for men with mild stress incontinence. The technique may ease symptoms of stress incontinence in some men.\n    \n    Injectable bulking agents. Synthetic polysaccharides or gels may be injected into tissues around the upper portion of the urethra. These materials bulk up the area around the urethra, improving the closing ability of the sphincter.\n    Retropubic colposuspension. This surgical procedure uses sutures attached to ligaments along the pubic bone to lift and support tissues near the bladder neck and upper portion of the urethra. This surgery can be done laparoscopically or by an incision in the abdomen.\n    Inflatable artificial sphincter. This surgically implanted device is used to treat men. A cuff, which fits around the upper portion of the urethra, replaces the function of the sphincter. Tubes connect the cuff to a pressure-regulating balloon in the pelvic region and a manually operated pump in the scrotum.\nMore InformationStress incontinence care at Mayo ClinicNon-mesh sling\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

But stage 4 prostate cancer often can't be cured.\n        \n            \n            Hormone therapyHormone therapy is treatment to stop your body from producing the male hormone testosterone or to block the effects of testosterone on the cancer. Prostate cancer cells rely on testosterone to help them grow. Cutting off the supply of hormones may cause the cancer to shrink or to slow its growth.\nIn men with stage 4 prostate cancer, hormone therapy is most often used alone, but it can be combined with chemotherapy and it may be used after radiation therapy or, rarely, surgery. Hormone therapy may be continued for as long as the treatment continues to work.\nHormone therapy options include:\n\n    Medications that stop your body from producing testosterone. Medications known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists and antagonists prevent the testicles from receiving messages to make testosterone. Drugs typically used in this type of hormone therapy include leuprolide (Eligard, Lupron Depot, others), goserelin (Zoladex), triptorelin (Trelstar), histrelin (Vantas) and degarelix (Firmagon).\n    Surgery to remove the testicles (orchiectomy). Removing your testicles reduces testosterone levels in your body. The effectiveness of orchiectomy in lowering testosterone levels is similar to that of hormone therapy medications, but orchiectomy may lower testosterone levels more quickly.\n    \n    Medications that block testosterone from reaching cancer cells. Medications known as anti-androgens prevent testosterone from reaching your cancer cells. Examples include bicalutamide (Casodex), flutamide and nilutamide (Nilandron). These drugs may be given along with an LH-RH agonist or given before taking an LH-RH agonist.\n    Apalutamide (Erleada) and enzalutamide (Xtandi) work differently from other anti-androgen drugs and may be an option if other hormone therapy treatments are no longer effective.\n    \n    Other medications. Other medications that work differently from other hormone therapies to control testosterone in the body may be options. Examples include abiraterone (Yonsa, Zytiga), the antifungal medication ketoconazole, the female hormone estrogen, and steroid drugs.\n\nSide effects of hormone therapy may include erectile dysfunction, hot flashes, loss of bone mass, reduced sex drive, breast enlargement and weight gain.\nMost advanced prostate cancers will eventually adapt to hormone therapy and begin growing despite treatment (castration-resistant prostate cancer). When that occurs, your doctor may recommend switching to a different combination of hormone therapy drugs to see if your cancer responds.\n        \n            \n            Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy for stage 4 prostate cancer uses a large machine that moves around your body, directing energy beams to the area around the cancer (external beam radiation therapy).\nIn men with very large prostate tumors or cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes (locally advanced prostate cancer), radiation therapy may be combined with hormone therapy. Or it may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain.\nIn men with cancer that has spread to other areas of the body, radiation therapy is used to relieve pain or other symptoms.\n        \n            \n            SurgerySurgery isn't often used to treat stage 4 prostate cancer, but it might be recommended in certain situations. In men with stage 4 prostate cancer, surgery is generally limited to men who are experiencing signs and symptoms that would be relieved by surgery, such as difficulty passing urine.\nSurgery may include:\n\n    Radical prostatectomy. Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove your prostate and any cancer that has grown locally beyond the prostate. Surgery may be an option if your prostate cancer is locally advanced and hasn't spread to other areas of the body.\n    Lymph node removal. Your doctor may recommend removal of several lymph nodes near your prostate (pelvic lymph node dissection) to test for cancer cells.\n\nSurgery can cause infection, bleeding, incontinence, erectile dysfunction and damage to the rectum.\n        \n            \n            Treatments for cancer that spreads to other areas of the bodyIf your cancer has spread beyond your prostate to other areas of your body, your doctor may recommend:\n\n    Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can slow the growth of cancer cells, relieve signs and symptoms of cancer, and prolong the lives of men with advanced prostate cancer.\n    Training your immune system to recognize cancer cells. Immunotherapy uses your immune system to kill cancer cells. Sipuleucel-T (Provenge), a form of immunotherapy, has been developed to genetically engineer your immune cells to fight prostate cancer.\n    Bone-building medications. Medications used to treat thinning bones (osteoporosis) may be helpful in preventing broken bones in men with prostate cancer that has spread to the bones.\n    Infusions of a radioactive drug. Men with prostate cancer that has spread to the bones may consider treatment that infuses a radioactive substance into a vein. Strontium-89 (Metastron), samarium-153 (Quadramet) and radium-223 (Xofigo) are medications that target fast-growing cancer cells in the bones, and may help relieve bone pain.\n    Radiation therapy. External beam radiation therapy may help control bone pain in men with prostate cancer that has spread to the bones.\n    Targeted drug therapy. Targeted drugs attack specific weaknesses in the cancer cells. Your doctor might have samples of your cancer tested in a lab to see if targeted therapy might be helpful for you.\n    Pain medications and treatments. Medications and treatments are available if you experience cancer pain. Which pain treatments are right for you will depend on your particular situation and your preferences.\n\n        \n            \n            Supportive (palliative) carePalliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing other aggressive treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\nWhen palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer.\nPalliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families.

These problems can reduce the amount of space available for your spinal cord and the nerves that branch off it.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe backbone (spine) runs from your neck to your lower back. The bones of your spine form a spinal canal, which protects your spinal cord (nerves).\nSome people are born with a small spinal canal. But most spinal stenosis occurs when something happens to narrow the open space within the spine. Causes of spinal stenosis may include:\n\n    Overgrowth of bone. Wear and tear damage from osteoarthritis on your spinal bones can prompt the formation of bone spurs, which can grow into the spinal canal. Paget's disease, a bone disease that usually affects adults, also can cause bone overgrowth in the spine.\n    Herniated disks. The soft cushions that act as shock absorbers between your vertebrae tend to dry out with age. Cracks in a disk's exterior may allow some of the soft inner material to escape and press on the spinal cord or nerves.\n    Thickened ligaments. The tough cords that help hold the bones of your spine together can become stiff and thickened over time. These thickened ligaments can bulge into the spinal canal.\n    Tumors. Abnormal growths can form inside the spinal cord, within the membranes that cover the spinal cord or in the space between the spinal cord and vertebrae. These are uncommon and identifiable on spine imaging with an MRI or CT.\n    Spinal injuries. Car accidents and other trauma can cause dislocations or fractures of one or more vertebrae. Displaced bone from a spinal fracture may damage the contents of the spinal canal. Swelling of nearby tissue immediately after back surgery also can put pressure on the spinal cord or nerves.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To diagnose spinal stenosis, your doctor may ask you about signs and symptoms, discuss your medical history, and conduct a physical examination. He or she may order several imaging tests to help pinpoint the cause of your signs and symptoms.\n        \n            \n            Imaging testsThese tests may include:\n\n    X-rays. An X-ray of your back can reveal bony changes, such as bone spurs that may be narrowing the space within the spinal canal. Each X-ray involves a small exposure to radiation.\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of your spine. The test can detect damage to your disks and ligaments, as well as the presence of tumors. Most important, it can show where the nerves in the spinal cord are being pressured.\n    CT or CT myelogram. If you can't have an MRI, your doctor may recommend computerized tomography (CT), a test that combines X-ray images taken from many different angles to produce detailed, cross-sectional images of your body. In a CT myelogram, the CT scan is conducted after a contrast dye is injected. The dye outlines the spinal cord and nerves, and it can reveal herniated disks, bone spurs and tumors.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your spinal stenosis-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationSpinal stenosis care at Mayo ClinicCT scanMRIX-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\t\n\n    \n    Spinal stenosis surgery\n    \n\n\nTreatment for spinal stenosis depends on the location of the stenosis and the severity of your signs and symptoms.\nTalk to your doctor about the treatment that's best for your situation. If your symptoms are mild or you aren't experiencing any, your doctor may monitor your condition with regular follow-up appointments. He or she may offer some self-care tips that you can do at home. If these don't help, he or she may recommend medications or physical therapy. Surgery may be an option if other treatments haven't helped.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsYour doctor may prescribe:\n\n    Pain relievers. Pain medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen (Aleve, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) may be used temporarily to ease the discomfort of spinal stenosis. They are typically recommended for a short time only, as there's little evidence of benefit from long-term use.\n    Antidepressants. Nightly doses of tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, can help ease chronic pain.\n    Anti-seizure drugs. Some anti-seizure drugs, such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica), are used to reduce pain caused by damaged nerves.\n    Opioids. Drugs that contain codeine-related drugs such as oxycodone (Oxycontin, Roxicodone) and hydrocodone (Norco, Vicodin) may be useful for short-term pain relief. Opioids may also be considered cautiously for long-term treatment. But they carry the risk of serious side effects, including becoming habit forming.\n\n        \n            \n            Physical therapyIt's common for people who have spinal stenosis to become less active, in an effort to reduce pain. But that can lead to muscle weakness, which can result in more pain. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that may help:\n\n    Build up your strength and endurance\n    Maintain the flexibility and stability of your spine\n    Improve your balance\n\n        \n            \n            Steroid injectionsYour nerve roots may become irritated and swollen at the spots where they are being pinched. While injecting a steroid medication (corticosteroid) into the space around impingement won't fix the stenosis, it can help reduce the inflammation and relieve some of the pain.\nSteroid injections don't work for everyone. And repeated steroid injections can weaken nearby bones and connective tissue, so you can only get these injections a few times a year.\n        \n            \n            Decompression procedureWith this procedure, needle-like instruments are used to remove a portion of a thickened ligament in the back of the spinal column to increase spinal canal space and remove nerve root impingement.

The goals of surgery include relieving the pressure on your spinal cord or nerve roots by creating more space within the spinal canal. Surgery to decompress the area of stenosis is the most definitive way to try to resolve symptoms of spinal stenosis.\nResearch shows that spine surgeries result in fewer complications when done by highly experienced surgeons. Don't hesitate to ask about your surgeon's experience with spinal stenosis surgery. If you have any doubts, get a second opinion.\nExamples of surgical procedures to treat spinal stenosis include:\n\n    \n    Laminectomy. This procedure removes the back part (lamina) of the affected vertebra. A laminectomy is sometimes called decompression surgery because it eases the pressure on the nerves by creating more space around them.\n    In some cases, that vertebra may need to be linked to adjoining vertebrae with metal hardware and a bone graft (spinal fusion) to maintain the spine's strength.\n    \n    Laminotomy. This procedure removes only a portion of the lamina, typically carving a hole just big enough to relieve the pressure in a particular spot.\n    Laminoplasty. This procedure is performed only on the vertebrae in the neck (cervical spine). It opens up the space within the spinal canal by creating a hinge on the lamina. Metal hardware bridges the gap in the opened section of the spine.\n    \n    Minimally invasive surgery. This approach to surgery removes bone or lamina in a way that reduces the damage to nearby healthy tissue. This results in less need to do fusions.\n    While fusions are a useful way to stabilize the spine and reduce pain, by avoiding them you can reduce potential risks, such as post-surgical pain and inflammation and disease in nearby sections of the spine. In addition to reducing the need for spinal fusion, a minimally invasive approach to surgery has been shown to result in a shorter recovery time.\n    \n\nIn most cases, these space-creating operations help reduce spinal stenosis symptoms. But some people's symptoms stay the same or get worse after surgery. Other surgical risks include infection, a tear in the membrane that covers the spinal cord, a blood clot in a leg vein and neurological deterioration.\n        \n            \n            Potential future treatmentsClinical trials are underway to test the use of stem cells to treat degenerative spinal disease, an approach sometimes called regenerative medicine. Genomic medicine trials are also being done, which could result in new gene therapies for spinal stenosis.\n        \n            \n            Alternative medicineIntegrative medicine and alternative therapies may be used with conventional treatments to help you cope with spinal stenosis pain. Examples include:\n\n    Massage therapy\n    Chiropractic treatment\n    Acupuncture\n\nTalk with your doctor if you're interested in these treatment options.More InformationSpinal stenosis care at Mayo ClinicCortisone shotsLaminectomySpinal fusionShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

But it's usually not known whether such genetic defects are inherited or simply develop over time. They might be caused by something in the environment, such as exposure to certain chemicals. In some cases, however, spinal cord tumors are linked to known inherited syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis 2 and von Hippel-Lindau disease.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    MRI scan of spinal cord tumor\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMRI scan of spinal cord tumor\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMRI scan of spinal cord tumor\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nSpinal tumors sometimes might be overlooked because they're not common and their symptoms resemble those of more common conditions. For that reason, it's especially important that your doctor know your complete medical history and perform both general physical and neurological exams.\nIf your doctor suspects a spinal tumor, these tests can help confirm the diagnosis and pinpoint the tumor's location:\n\n    \n    Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to produce accurate images of your spine, spinal cord and nerves. MRI is usually the preferred test to diagnose tumors of the spinal cord and surrounding tissues. A contrast agent that helps highlight certain tissues and structures may be injected into a vein in your hand or forearm during the test.\n    Some people may feel claustrophobic inside the MRI scanner or find the loud thumping sound it makes disturbing. But you're usually given earplugs to help with the noise, and some scanners are equipped with televisions or headphones. If you're very anxious, ask about a mild sedative to help calm you. In certain situations, a general anesthetic may be necessary.\n    \n\t\n\n    \n    \n    MRI scan\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            \n    Computerized tomography (CT). This test uses a narrow beam of radiation to produce detailed images of your spine. Sometimes it's combined with an injected contrast dye to make abnormal changes in the spinal canal or spinal cord easier to see. A CT scan is only rarely used to help diagnose spinal tumors.\n    Biopsy. The only way to determine the exact type of a spinal tumor is to examine a small tissue sample (biopsy) under a microscope. The biopsy results will help determine treatment options.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your spinal cord tumor-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationSpinal cord tumor care at Mayo ClinicCT scanMRINeedle biopsyShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Ideally, the goal of spinal tumor treatment is to eliminate the tumor completely, but this goal may be complicated by the risk of permanent damage to the spinal cord and surrounding nerves. Doctors also must take into account your age and overall health. The type of tumor and whether it arises from the structures of the spine or spinal canal or has spread to your spine from elsewhere in your body also must be considered in determining a treatment plan.\n        \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Spinal tumor neck surgery\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpinal tumor neck surgery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSpinal tumor neck surgery\n\t\t\t\tUsing microsurgical techniques, a tumor is gently teased out of the spinal cord in the cervical spine.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nTreatment options for most spinal tumors include:\n\n    \n    Monitoring. Some spinal tumors may be discovered before they cause symptoms \u2014 often when you're being evaluated for another condition. If small tumors aren't growing or pressing on surrounding tissues, watching them carefully may be all that's needed. \n    During observation, your doctor will likely recommend periodic CT or MRI scans at an appropriate interval to monitor the tumor.\n    \n    \n    Surgery.This is often the treatment of choice for tumors that can be removed with an acceptable risk of spinal cord or nerve injury damage.\n    Newer techniques and instruments allow neurosurgeons to reach tumors that were once considered inaccessible. The high-powered microscopes used in microsurgery make it easier to distinguish tumor from healthy tissue.\n    Doctors also can monitor the function of the spinal cord and other important nerves during surgery, thus minimizing the chance of injuring them. In some instances, very high-frequency sound waves might be used during surgery to break up tumors and remove the fragments. \n    But even with the latest technological advances in surgery, not all tumors can be totally removed. When the tumor can't be removed completely, surgery may be followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy or both.\n    Recovery from spinal surgery may take weeks or longer, depending on the procedure. You may experience a temporary loss of sensation or other complications, including bleeding and damage to nerve tissue. \n    \n\t\n\n    \n    Pediatric neurosurgery consultation\n    \n\n\n\n        \n            \n            \n    \n    Radiation therapy. This may be used to eliminate the remnants of tumors that remain after surgery, to treat inoperable tumors or to treat those tumors where surgery is too risky.\n    Medications may help ease some of the side effects of radiation, such as nausea and vomiting. \n    Sometimes, your radiation therapy regimen may be adjusted to help minimize the amount of healthy tissue that's damaged and to make the treatment more effective. Modifications may range from simply changing the dosage of radiation to using sophisticated techniques such as 3-D conformal radiation therapy.\n    \n    \n    Chemotherapy. A standard treatment for many types of cancer, chemotherapy uses medications to destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing. Your doctor can determine whether chemotherapy might be beneficial for you, either alone or in combination with radiation therapy.\n    Side effects may include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, increased risk of infection and hair loss.\n    \n    \n    Other drugs. Because surgery and radiation therapy as well as tumors themselves can cause inflammation inside the spinal cord, doctors sometimes prescribe corticosteroids to reduce the swelling, either after surgery or during radiation treatments.\n    Although corticosteroids reduce inflammation, they are usually used only for short periods to avoid serious side effects such as muscle weakness, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, diabetes and an increased susceptibility to infection. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

Others may experience symptoms that are debilitating or life-threatening.\nSymptoms usually develop when people are in their 20s, although almost 20% of people diagnosed with spinal AVM are under the age of 16.\nThe emergence of symptoms may be sudden or gradual. Symptoms typically include:\n\n    Problems with walking or climbing stairs\n    Numbness, tingling or sudden pain in your legs\n    Weakness on one or both sides of your body\n\nAs the condition progresses, additional symptoms may include:\n\n    Sudden, severe back pain\n    Lack of feeling in the legs\n    Difficulty urinating or moving your bowels\n    Headache\n    Stiff neck\n    Sensitivity to light\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorMake an appointment with your doctor if you experience signs and symptoms of spinal arteriovenous malformation.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The specific cause isn't known.

A spinal MRI can identify a mass resulting from abnormally connected blood vessels associated with AVM.\n    \n    Angiography, which is usually needed to determine the location and characteristics of the blood vessels involved in the AVM.\n    In an angiography, a thin tube (catheter) is inserted into an artery in your groin and guided to your spinal cord. Dye is injected into blood vessels in your spinal cord to make them visible under X-ray imaging.\n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM)-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\t\n\n    \n    Spinal AVM surgery at Mayo Clinic\n    Mayo Clinic neurosurgeons use the latest tools and techniques to treat spinal AVM.\n\n\nTreatment for spinal AVM may involve a combination of approaches to lessen symptoms as well as reduce the risk of potential complications. The choice of treatment will depend on the size, location and blood flow of your spinal AVM, your neurological exam, and your overall health.\nThe goal of spinal AVM treatment is to reduce the risk of hemorrhage and stop or prevent the progression of disability and other symptoms.\n        \n            \n            MedicationPain-relieving medications may be used to reduce symptoms such as back pain and stiffness, but most spinal AVMs will eventually require surgery.\n        \n            \n            Surgery\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Close-up of endovascular embolization\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tClose-up of endovascular embolization\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tClose-up of endovascular embolization\n\t\t\t\tIn endovascular embolization for AVM, a catheter deposits particles of a glue-like substance in the affected artery to block blood flow\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nSurgery is usually needed to remove a spinal AVM from the surrounding tissue. There are three ways to remove the spinal AVM:\n\n    Conventional surgery. In this procedure, a surgeon makes an incision to remove the AVM, taking care to avoid damaging the spinal cord and other surrounding areas. Surgery is usually performed when the AVM is fairly small and in an area of the spinal cord that's easy to reach.\n    \n    Endovascular embolization. Endovascular embolization is a minimally invasive radiological procedure used to reduce the risk of hemorrhage and other complications associated with spinal AVMs.\n    In endovascular embolization, a catheter is inserted into an artery in your leg and threaded to an artery in your spinal cord that is feeding your AVM. Small particles of a glue-like substance are injected to block the artery and reduce blood flow into the AVM. It doesn't permanently destroy the AVM.\n    Your doctor may recommend endovascular embolization before conventional surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding during surgery or to reduce the size of the AVM so that surgery is more successful.\n    \n    Radiosurgery. This procedure uses radiation focused directly on the AVM to destroy the blood vessels of the malformation. Over time, those blood vessels break down and close up. Radiosurgery is most often used to treat small, unruptured AVMs.\n\nYour doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of surgery to remove your AVM. The close proximity of the AVM to the spinal cord means spinal AVM surgery is a technically difficult and complex procedure that should be performed by an experienced neurosurgeon.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

The tests aren't perfect. Some mothers who have positive blood tests have babies without spina bifida. Even if the results are negative, there's still a small chance that spina bifida is present. Talk to your doctor about prenatal testing, its risks and how you might handle the results.\n        \n            \n            Blood testsSpina bifida can be screened with maternal blood tests, but typically the diagnosis is made with ultrasound.\n\n    Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) test. For the MSAFP test, a sample of the mother's blood is drawn and tested for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) \u2014 a protein produced by the baby. It's normal for a small amount of AFP to cross the placenta and enter the mother's bloodstream. But abnormally high levels of AFP suggest that the baby has a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida, though high levels of AFP don't always occur in spina bifida.\n    Test to confirm high AFP levels. Varying levels of AFP can be caused by other factors \u2014 including a miscalculation in fetal age or multiple babies \u2014 so your doctor may order a follow-up blood test for confirmation. If the results are still high, you'll need further evaluation, including an ultrasound exam.\n    Other blood tests. Your doctor may perform the MSAFP test with two or three other blood tests. These tests are commonly done with the MSAFP test, but their objective is to screen for other abnormalities, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), not neural tube defects.\n\n        \n            \n            UltrasoundFetal ultrasound is the most accurate method to diagnose spina bifida in your baby before delivery. Ultrasound can be performed during the first trimester (11 to 14 weeks) and second trimester (18 to 22 weeks). Spina bifida can be accurately diagnosed during the second trimester ultrasound scan. Therefore, this examination is crucial to identify and rule out congenital anomalies such as spina bifida.\nAn advanced ultrasound also can detect signs of spina bifida, such as an open spine or particular features in your baby's brain that indicate spina bifida. In expert hands, ultrasound is also effective in assessing severity.\t\n\n    \n    \n    In expert hands, ultrasound is quite effective in detecting spina bifida and assessing its severity.\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            AmniocentesisIf the prenatal ultrasound confirms the diagnosis of spina bifida, your doctor may request amniocentesis. During amniocentesis, your doctor uses a needle to remove a sample of fluid from the amniotic sac that surrounds the baby.\nThis examination may be important to rule out genetic diseases, despite the fact that spina bifida is rarely associated with genetic diseases.\nDiscuss the risks of amniocentesis, including a slight risk of loss of the pregnancy, with your doctor.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your spina bifida-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationSpina bifida care at Mayo ClinicAmniocentesisUltrasound\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Spina bifida treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Spina bifida occulta often doesn't require any treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do.\n        \n            \n            Surgery before birthNerve function in babies with spina bifida can worsen after birth if spina bifida isn't treated. Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose the pregnant mother's uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby's spinal cord. In select patients, this procedure can also be performed less invasively with a fetoscope through ports in the uterus.\nResearch suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. Fetal surgery may also reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you. Discuss the potential benefits and risks, such as possible premature delivery and other complications, for you and your baby.\nIt's important to have a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether fetal surgery is feasible. This specialized surgery should only be done at a health care facility that has experienced fetal surgery experts, a multispecialty team approach and neonatal intensive care. Typically the team includes a fetal surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, fetal cardiologist and neonatologist.\n        \n            \n            Cesarean birthMany babies with myelomeningocele tend to be in a feet-first (breech) position. If your baby is in this position or if your doctor has detected a large cyst or sac, cesarean birth may be a safer way to deliver your baby.\n        \n            \n            Surgery after birthMyelomeningocele requires surgery. Performing the surgery early can help minimize the risk of infection associated with the exposed nerves. It may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma.\nDuring the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby's body and covers them with muscle and skin. At the same time, the neurosurgeon may place a shunt in the baby's brain to control hydrocephalus.\n        \n            \n            \t\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\nTreatment for complicationsIn babies with myelomeningocele, irreparable nerve damage has likely already occurred and ongoing care from a multispecialty team of surgeons, physicians and therapists is usually needed. Babies with myelomeningocele may need more surgery for a variety of complications. Treatment for complications \u2014 such as weak legs, bladder and bowel problems, or hydrocephalus \u2014 typically begins soon after birth.\nDepending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment options may include:\n\n    Walking and mobility aids. Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they're older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. Even children who need a wheelchair can learn to function very well and become self-sufficient.\n    Bowel and bladder management. Routine bowel and bladder evaluations and management plans help reduce the risk of organ damage and illness. Evaluations include X-rays, kidney scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and bladder function studies. These evaluations will be more frequent in the first few years of life but less often as children grow. A specialist in pediatric urology with experience in evaluating and performing surgery on children with spina bifida may offer the most effective management options.\n    \n        Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery or a combination of these approaches.\n        Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery or a combination of treatments.\n    \n    Surgery for hydrocephalus. Most babies with myelomeningocele will need a surgically placed tube that allows fluid in the brain to drain into the abdomen (ventricular shunt). This tube might be placed just after birth, during the surgery to close the sac on the lower back or later as fluid accumulates. A less invasive procedure, called endoscopic third ventriculostomy, may be an option. But candidates must be carefully chosen and meet certain criteria. During the procedure, the surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain and makes a hole in the bottom of or between the ventricles so cerebrospinal fluid can flow out of the brain.\n    Treatment and management of other complications. Special equipment such as bath chairs, commode chairs and standing frames may help with daily functioning. Whatever the issue \u2014 orthopedic complications, tethered spinal cord, GI issues, skin problems or others \u2014 most spina bifida complications can be treated or at least managed to improve quality of life.\n\n        \n            \n            \t\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\nOngoing careChildren with spina bifida need close follow-up care and observation.

Gradual, repeated exposure to the source of your specific phobia and the related thoughts, feelings and sensations may help you learn to manage your anxiety. For example, if you're afraid of elevators, your therapy may progress from simply thinking about getting into an elevator, to looking at pictures of elevators, to going near an elevator, to stepping into an elevator. Next, you may take a one-floor ride, then ride several floors, and then ride in a crowded elevator.\n    Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) involves exposure combined with other techniques to learn ways to view and cope with the feared object or situation differently. You learn alternative beliefs about your fears and bodily sensations and the impact they've had on your life. CBT emphasizes learning to develop a sense of mastery and confidence with your thoughts and feelings rather than feeling overwhelmed by them.\n\n        \n            \n            MedicationsGenerally psychotherapy using exposure therapy is successful in treating specific phobias.

Sometimes medications may be added, especially if you're struggling with feeling depressed.\n        \n            \n            PsychotherapyBecause physical symptoms can be related to psychological distress and a high level of health anxiety, psychotherapy \u2014 specifically, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) \u2014 can help improve physical symptoms.\nCBT can help you:\n\n    Examine and adapt your beliefs and expectations about health and physical symptoms\n    Learn how to reduce stress\n    Learn how to cope with physical symptoms\n    Reduce preoccupation with symptoms\n    Reduce avoidance of situations and activities due to uncomfortable physical sensations\n    Improve daily functioning at home, at work, in relationships and in social situations\n    Address depression and other mental health disorders\n\nFamily therapy may also be helpful by examining family relationships and improving family support and functioning.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsAntidepressant medication can help reduce symptoms associated with depression and pain that often occur with somatic symptom disorder.\nIf one medication doesn't work well for you, your doctor may recommend switching to another or combining certain medications to boost effectiveness. Keep in mind that it can take several weeks after first starting a medication to notice an improvement in symptoms.\nTalk with your doctor about medication options and the possible side effects and risks.More InformationPsychotherapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Your doctor will remove an area of suspicious tissue and send it to a lab for testing. In the lab, specially trained doctors (pathologists) will look for signs of cancer.\n    Taking imaging tests.

The goal of surgery is to remove as much of the cancer as possible. If the cancer is small, it may be removed during a short operation that won't require a hospital stay. Larger cancers may require more-extensive operations. When the cancer has spread to the neck lymph nodes, lymph node removal may be necessary.\n    Radiation therapy. Radiation uses beams of intense energy, such as X-rays and protons to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy can be used alone or with chemotherapy or surgery to treat soft palate cancers of all stages.\n    Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be combined with radiation therapy.\n    Reconstructive surgery. Depending on where the cancer is located and how far it has spread, reconstructive surgery may be necessary.\n    Rehabilitative services. Rehabilitation specialists in speech therapy, swallowing therapy, dietetics, physical therapy and occupational therapy help with rehabilitation that may be necessary after surgery or radiation therapy.\n    Palliative care. Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness.

{"Diseases": "Snoring", "Symptoms": "Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Not all snorers have OSA, but if snoring is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it may be an indication to see a doctor for further evaluation for OSA:\n\n    Witnessed breathing pauses during sleep\n    Excessive daytime sleepiness\n    Difficulty concentrating\n    Morning headaches\n    Sore throat upon awakening\n    Restless sleep\n    Gasping or choking at night\n    High blood pressure\n    Chest pain at night\n    Your snoring is so loud it's disrupting your partner's sleep\n    In children, poor attention span, behavioral issues or poor performance in school\n\nOSA often is characterized by loud snoring followed by periods of silence when breathing stops or nearly stops. Eventually, this reduction or pause in breathing may signal you to wake up, and you may awaken with a loud snort or gasping sound.\nYou may sleep lightly due to disrupted sleep. This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night.\nPeople with obstructive sleep apnea usually experience periods when breathing slows or stops at least five times during every hour of sleep.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorSee your doctor if you have any of the above symptoms. These may indicate your snoring is associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).\nIf your child snores, ask your pediatrician about it. Children can have OSA, too. Nose and throat problems \u2014 such as enlarged tonsils \u2014 and obesity often can narrow a child's airway, which can lead to your child developing OSA.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Snoring\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSnoring\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tSnoring\r\n\t\t\t\tSnoring occurs when air flows past relaxed tissues, such as your tongue, soft palate and airway, as you breathe. The sagging tissues narrow your airway, causing these tissues to vibrate.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSnoring can be caused by a number of factors, such as the anatomy of your mouth and sinuses, alcohol consumption, allergies, a cold, and your weight.\nWhen you doze off and progress from a light sleep to a deep sleep, the muscles in the roof of your mouth (soft palate), tongue and throat relax. The tissues in your throat can relax enough that they partially block your airway and vibrate.\nThe more narrowed your airway, the more forceful the airflow becomes. This increases tissue vibration, which causes your snoring to grow louder.\nThe following conditions can affect the airway and cause snoring:\n\n    Your mouth anatomy. Having a low, thick soft palate can narrow your airway. People who are overweight may have extra tissues in the back of their throats that may narrow their airways. Likewise, if the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate (uvula) is elongated, airflow can be obstructed and vibration increased.\n    Alcohol consumption. Snoring can also be brought on by consuming too much alcohol before bedtime. Alcohol relaxes throat muscles and decreases your natural defenses against airway obstruction.\n    Nasal problems. Chronic nasal congestion or a crooked partition between your nostrils (deviated nasal septum) may contribute to your snoring.\n    Sleep deprivation. Not getting enough sleep can lead to further throat relaxation.\n    Sleep position. Snoring is typically most frequent and loudest when sleeping on the back as gravity's effect on the throat narrows the airway.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, and your medical history. Your doctor will also perform a physical examination.\nYour doctor may ask your partner some questions about when and how you snore to help assess the severity of the problem. If your child snores, you'll be asked about the severity of your child's snoring.\n        \n            \n            ImagingYour doctor may request an imaging test, such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. These tests check the structure of your airway for problems, such as a deviated septum.\n        \n            \n            Sleep studyDepending on the severity of your snoring and other symptoms, your doctor may want to conduct a sleep study. Sleep studies may sometimes be done at home.\nHowever, depending upon your other medical problems and other sleep symptoms, you may need to stay overnight at a sleep center to undergo an in-depth analysis of your breathing during sleep by a study, called a polysomnography.\nIn a polysomnography, you're connected to many sensors and observed overnight. During the sleep study, the following information is recorded:\n\n    Brain waves\n    Blood oxygen level\n    Heart rate\n    Breathing rate\n    Sleep stages\n    Eye and leg movements\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your snoring-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationSnoring care at Mayo ClinicCT scanMRIPolysomnography (sleep study)X-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n\t\t\t\tTo eliminate snoring and prevent sleep apnea, your doctor may recommend a device called a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. A CPAP machine delivers just enough air pressure to a mask to keep your upper airway passages open, preventing snoring and sleep apnea.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nTo treat your snoring, your doctor likely will first recommend lifestyle changes, such as:\n\n    Losing weight\n    Avoiding alcohol close to bedtime\n    Treating nasal congestion\n    Avoiding sleep deprivation\n    Avoiding sleeping on your back\n\nFor snoring accompanied by OSA, your doctor may suggest:\n\n    \n    Oral appliances. Oral appliances are form-fitting dental mouthpieces that help advance the position of your jaw, tongue and soft palate to keep your air passage open.\n    If you choose to use an oral appliance, you'll work with your dental specialist to optimize the fit and position of the appliance. You'll also work with your sleep specialist to make sure the oral appliance is working as intended. Dental visits may be necessary at least once every six months during the first year, and then at least annually after that, to have the fit checked and to assess your oral health.\n    Excessive salivation, dry mouth, jaw pain and facial discomfort are possible side effects from wearing these devices.\n    \n    \n    Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This approach involves wearing a mask over your nose or mouth while you sleep. The mask directs pressurized air from a small bedside pump to your airway to keep it open during sleep.\n    CPAP (SEE-pap) eliminates snoring and is most often used to treating snoring when associated with OSA.\n    Although CPAP is the most reliable and effective method of treating OSA, some people find it uncomfortable or have trouble adjusting to the noise or feel of the machine.\n    \n    \n    Upper airway surgery. There are a number of procedures that seek to open the upper airway and prevent significant narrowing during sleep through a variety of techniques.\n    For example, in a procedure called uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), you're given general anesthetics and your surgeon tightens and trims excess tissues from your throat \u2014 a type of face-lift for your throat. Another procedure called maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) involves moving the upper and lower jaws forward, which helps open the airway. Radiofrequency tissue ablation employs a low-intensity radiofrequency signal to shrink tissue in the soft palate, tongue or nose.\n    A newer surgical technique called hypoglossal nerve stimulation employs a stimulus applied to the nerve that controls forward movement of the tongue so the tongue does not block the airway when you take a breath.\n    The effectiveness of these surgeries varies and the response can be challenging to predict.\n    \nMore InformationSnoring care at Mayo ClinicPillar procedure\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

These muscles support structures including the back of the roof of your mouth (soft palate), the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate (uvula), the tonsils and the tongue.\n\nWhen the muscles relax, your airway narrows or closes as you breathe in, hampering your breathing for 10 seconds or longer. This can lower the level of oxygen in your blood and cause a buildup of carbon dioxide.\n\nYour brain senses this impaired breathing and briefly rouses you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway. This awakening is usually so brief that you don't remember it.\n\nYou can awaken with shortness of breath that corrects itself quickly, within one or two deep breaths. You might make a snorting, choking or gasping sound.\n\nThis pattern can repeat itself five to 30 times or more each hour, all night long. These disruptions impair your ability to reach the deep, restful phases of sleep, and you'll probably feel sleepy during your waking hours.\n\nPeople with obstructive sleep apnea might not be aware of their interrupted sleep.

If you have obstructive sleep apnea, you may benefit from positive airway pressure. In this treatment, a machine delivers air pressure through a piece that fits into your nose or is placed over your nose and mouth while you sleep.\n\nPositive airway pressure reduces the number of respiratory events that occur as you sleep, reduces daytime sleepiness and improves your quality of life.\n\nThe most common type is called continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP (SEE-pap). With this treatment, the pressure of the air breathed is continuous, constant and somewhat greater than that of the surrounding air, which is just enough to keep your upper airway passages open. This air pressure prevents obstructive sleep apnea and snoring.\n\nAlthough CPAP is the most consistently successful and most commonly used method of treating obstructive sleep apnea, some people find the mask cumbersome, uncomfortable or loud. However, newer machines are smaller and less noisy than older machines and there are a variety of mask designs for individual comfort.\n\nAlso, with some practice, most people learn to adjust the mask to obtain a comfortable and secure fit. You may need to try different types to find a suitable mask. Several options are available, such as nasal masks, nasal pillows or face masks.\n\nIf you're having particular difficulties tolerating pressure, some machines have special adaptive pressure functions to improve comfort. You might also benefit from using a humidifier along with your CPAP system. \n\nCPAP may be given at a continuous (fixed) pressure or varied (autotitrating) pressure (APAP). In fixed CPAP, the pressure stays constant. In autotitrating CPAP, the levels of pressure are adjusted if the device senses increased airway resistance.\n\nBilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP), another type of positive airway pressure, delivers a preset amount of pressure when you breathe in and a different amount of pressure when you breathe out.\n\nCPAP is more commonly used because it's been well studied for obstructive sleep apnea and has been shown to effectively treat obstructive sleep apnea. However, for people who have difficulty tolerating fixed CPAP, BPAP or APAP might be worth a try.\n\nDon't stop using your positive airway pressure machine if you have problems. Check with your doctor to see what adjustments you can make to improve its comfort.\n\nIn addition, contact your doctor if you still snore despite treatment, if you begin snoring again, or if your weight goes up or down by 10% or more.\n\nMouthpiece (oral device). Though positive airway pressure is often an effective treatment, oral appliances are an alternative for some people with mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea. It's also used for people with severe sleep apnea who can't use CPAP. These devices may reduce your sleepiness and improve your quality of life.\n\nThese devices are designed to keep your throat open. Some devices keep your airway open by bringing your lower jaw forward, which can sometimes relieve snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. Other devices hold your tongue in a different position.\n\nIf you and your doctor decide to explore this option, you'll need to see a dentist experienced in dental sleep medicine appliances for the fitting and follow-up therapy. A number of devices are available. Close follow-up is needed to ensure successful treatment and that use of the device doesn't cause changes to your teeth.\n\n\n \n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n                \n                    \n                    \n                \n                    Nasal masks\n                    The mask covering the nose supplies air pressure.\n\nMight be good if:\n\nYour doctor has prescribed a high air pressure setting\nYou move around a lot in your sleep\n\n\n                \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                \n                    Full-face masks\n                    The mask covering the nose and mouth supplies air pressure.\n\nMight be good if:\n\nYou have nasal obstruction or congestion that makes breathing through your nose difficult\nYou breathe through your mouth at night despite a month of trying a nasal mask or nasal pillow interface combined with a heated humidity feature or chin strap or both to keep your mouth closed\n\n\n                \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                \n                    Which CPAP masks are best for you?\n                    Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks and headgear come in many styles and sizes to comfortably treat your sleep apnea.

When these muscles relax, your airway is narrowed or closed, and breathing is momentarily cut off.\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis occurs when the muscles in the back of your throat relax. These muscles support the soft palate, the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate (uvula), the tonsils, the side walls of the throat and the tongue.\nWhen the muscles relax, your airway narrows or closes as you breathe in. You can't get enough air, which can lower the oxygen level in your blood. Your brain senses your inability to breathe and briefly rouses you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway. This awakening is usually so brief that you don't remember it.\nYou might snort, choke or gasp. This pattern can repeat itself five to 30 times or more each hour, all night, impairing your ability to reach the deep, restful phases of sleep.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Central sleep apneaThis less common form of sleep apnea occurs when your brain fails to transmit signals to your breathing muscles. This means that you make no effort to breathe for a short period. You might awaken with shortness of breath or have a difficult time getting to sleep or staying asleep.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may make an evaluation based on your signs and symptoms and a sleep history, which you can provide with help from someone who shares your bed or your household, if possible.\nYou're likely to be referred to a sleep disorder center. There, a sleep specialist can help you determine your need for further evaluation.\nAn evaluation often involves overnight monitoring at a sleep center of your breathing and other body functions during sleep. Home sleep testing also might be an option. Tests to detect sleep apnea include:\n\n    Nocturnal polysomnography. During this test, you're hooked up to equipment that monitors your heart, lung and brain activity, breathing patterns, arm and leg movements, and blood oxygen levels while you sleep.\n    \n    Home sleep tests. Your doctor might provide you with simplified tests to be used at home to diagnose sleep apnea. These tests usually measure your heart rate, blood oxygen level, airflow and breathing patterns.\n    If the results are abnormal, your doctor might be able to prescribe a therapy without further testing. Portable monitoring devices don't detect all cases of sleep apnea, however, so your doctor might still recommend polysomnography even if your initial results are normal.\n    \n\nIf you have obstructive sleep apnea, your doctor might refer you to an ear, nose and throat doctor to rule out blockage in your nose or throat. An evaluation by a heart doctor (cardiologist) or a doctor who specializes in the nervous system (neurologist) might be necessary to look for causes of central sleep apnea.More InformationPolysomnography (sleep study)\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n\t\t\t\tTo eliminate snoring and prevent sleep apnea, your doctor may recommend a device called a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. A CPAP machine delivers just enough air pressure to a mask to keep your upper airway passages open, preventing snoring and sleep apnea.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nFor milder cases of sleep apnea, your doctor may recommend only lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or quitting smoking. If you have nasal allergies, your doctor will recommend treatment for your allergies.\nIf these measures don't improve your signs and symptoms or if your apnea is moderate to severe, a number of other treatments are available.\nCertain devices can help open up a blocked airway. In other cases, surgery might be necessary.\n\n        \n            \n            Therapies\n    \n    Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). If you have moderate to severe sleep apnea, you might benefit from using a machine that delivers air pressure through a mask while you sleep. With CPAP (SEE-pap), the air pressure is somewhat greater than that of the surrounding air and is just enough to keep your upper airway passages open, preventing apnea and snoring.\n    Although CPAP is the most common and reliable method of treating sleep apnea, some people find it cumbersome or uncomfortable. Some people give up on the CPAP machine, but with practice, most people learn to adjust the tension of the straps on the mask to obtain a comfortable and secure fit.\n    You might need to try more than one type of mask to find one that's comfortable. Don't stop using the CPAP machine if you have problems. Check with your doctor to see what changes can be made to increase your comfort.\n    Additionally, contact your doctor if you're still snoring or begin snoring again despite treatment. If your weight changes, the pressure settings of the CPAP machine might need to be adjusted.\n    \n    Other airway pressure devices. If using a CPAP machine continues to be a problem for you, you might be able to use a different type of airway pressure device that automatically adjusts the pressure while you're sleeping (auto-CPAP). Units that supply bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) also are available. These provide more pressure when you inhale and less when you exhale.\n    \n    Oral appliances. Another option is wearing an oral appliance designed to keep your throat open. CPAP is more reliably effective than oral appliances, but oral appliances might be easier to use. Some are designed to open your throat by bringing your jaw forward, which can sometimes relieve snoring and mild obstructive sleep apnea.\n    A number of devices are available from your dentist. You might need to try different devices before finding one that works for you.\n    Once you find the right fit, you'll need to follow up with your dentist repeatedly during the first year and then regularly after that to ensure that the fit is still good and to reassess your signs and symptoms.\n    \n    Treatment for associated medical problems. Possible causes of central sleep apnea include heart or neuromuscular disorders, and treating those conditions might help.\n    Supplemental oxygen. Using supplemental oxygen while you sleep might help if you have central sleep apnea. Various forms of oxygen are available with devices to deliver oxygen to your lungs.\n    \n    Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV). This more recently approved airflow device learns your normal breathing pattern and stores the information in a built-in computer. After you fall asleep, the machine uses pressure to normalize your breathing pattern and prevent pauses in your breathing.\n    ASV appears to be more successful than other forms of positive airway pressure at treating complex sleep apnea in some people. However, it might not be a good choice for people with predominant central sleep apnea and advanced heart failure.\n    \n\nYou'll likely read, hear or see TV ads about different treatments for sleep apnea. Talk with your doctor about any treatment before you try it.\n        \n            \n            SurgerySurgery is usually only an option after other treatments have failed. Generally, at least a three-month trial of other treatment options is suggested before considering surgery. However, for a small number of people with certain jaw structure problems, it's a good first option.\nSurgical options might include:\n\n    \n    Tissue removal. During this procedure (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty), your doctor removes tissue from the rear of your mouth and top of your throat. Your tonsils and adenoids usually are removed as well.\n    This type of surgery might be successful in stopping throat structures from vibrating and causing snoring. It's less effective than CPAP and isn't considered a reliable treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.\n    Removing tissues in the back of your throat with radiofrequency energy (radiofrequency ablation) might be an option if you can't tolerate CPAP or oral appliances.\n    \n    Tissue shrinkage. Another option is to shrink the tissue at the rear of your mouth and the back of your throat using radiofrequency ablation. This procedure might be used for mild to moderate sleep apnea. One study found this to have effects similar to that of tissue removal, but with fewer surgical risks.\n    Jaw repositioning. In this procedure, your jaw is moved forward from the remainder of your face bones. This enlarges the space behind the tongue and soft palate, making obstruction less likely. This procedure is known as maxillomandibular advancement.\n    Implants. Soft rods, usually made of polyester or plastic, are surgically implanted into the soft palate after you've received local anesthetic. More research is needed to determine how well implants work.\n    Nerve stimulation. This requires surgery to insert a stimulator for the nerve that controls tongue movement (hypoglossal nerve). The increased stimulation helps keep the tongue in a position that keeps the airway open. More research is needed.\n    \n    Creating a new air passageway (tracheostomy). You may need this form of surgery if other treatments have failed and you have severe, life-threatening sleep apnea. In this procedure, your surgeon makes an opening in your neck and inserts a metal or plastic tube through which you breathe.\n    You keep the opening covered during the day. But at night you uncover it to allow air to pass in and out of your lungs, bypassing the blocked air passage in your throat.\n    \n\nOther types of surgery may help reduce snoring and contribute to the treatment of sleep apnea by clearing or enlarging air passages:\n\n    Surgery to remove enlarged tonsils or adenoids\n    Weight-loss (bariatric) surgery\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n                \n                    \n                    \n                \n                    Nasal masks\n                    The mask covering the nose supplies air pressure.\nMight be good if:\n\n    Your doctor has prescribed a high air pressure setting\n    You move around a lot in your sleep\n\n                \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                \n                    Full-face masks\n                    The mask covering the nose and mouth supplies air pressure.\nMight be good if:\n\n    You have nasal obstruction or congestion that makes breathing through your nose difficult\n    You breathe through your mouth at night despite a month of trying a nasal mask or nasal pillow interface combined with a heated humidity feature or chin strap or both to keep your mouth closed\n\n                \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                \n                    Many CPAP mask options available\n                    Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks and headgear come in many styles and sizes to comfortably treat your sleep apnea.

Most of the time, STI screening is not a routine part of health care, but there are exceptions:\n\n    Everyone. The one STI screening test suggested for everyone ages 13 to 64 is a blood or saliva test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. Experts recommend that people at high risk have an HIV test every year.\n    Everyone born between 1945 and 1965. There's a high incidence of hepatitis C in people born between 1945 and 1965. Since the disease often causes no symptoms until it's advanced, experts recommend that everyone in that age group be screened for hepatitis C.\n    Pregnant women. All pregnant women will generally be screened for HIV, hepatitis B, chlamydia and syphilis at their first prenatal visit. Gonorrhea and hepatitis C screening tests are recommended at least once during pregnancy for women at high risk of these infections.\n    Women age 21 and older. The Pap test screens for cervical abnormalities, including inflammation, precancerous changes and cancer, which is often caused by certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV). Experts recommend that women have a Pap test every three years starting at age 21. After age 30, experts recommend women have an HPV DNA test and a Pap test every five years. A Pap test every three years is also acceptable.\n    \n    Women under age 25 who are sexually active. Experts recommend that all sexually active women under age 25 be tested for chlamydia infection. The chlamydia test uses a sample of urine or vaginal fluid you can collect yourself.\n    Some experts recommend repeating the chlamydia test three months after you've had a positive test and been treated. Reinfection by an untreated or undertreated partner is common, so you need the second test to confirm that the infection is cured. You can catch chlamydia multiple times, so get retested if you have a new partner.\n    Screening for gonorrhea is also recommended in sexually active women under age 25.\n    \n    Men who have sex with men. Compared with other groups, men who have sex with men run a higher risk of acquiring STIs. Many public health groups recommend annual or more-frequent STI screening for these men. Regular tests for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea are particularly important. Evaluation for hepatitis B also may be recommended.\n    \n    People with HIV. If you have HIV, it dramatically raises your risk of catching other STIs. Experts recommend immediate testing for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and herpes after being diagnosed with HIV. They also recommend that people with HIV be screened for hepatitis C.\n    Women with HIV may develop aggressive cervical cancer, so experts recommend they have a Pap test within a year of being diagnosed with HIV, and then again six months later.\n    \n    \n    People who have a new partner. Before having vaginal or anal intercourse with new partners, be sure you've both been tested for STIs. However, routine testing for genital herpes isn't recommended unless you have symptoms.\n    It's also possible to be infected with an STI yet still test negative, particularly if you've recently been infected.\n    \nMore InformationSTD testingComplete blood count (CBC)HIV testingHPV testPap smearUrinalysisShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by bacteria are generally easier to treat. Viral infections can be managed but not always cured. If you are pregnant and have an STI, getting treatment right away can prevent or reduce the risk of your baby becoming infected.\nTreatment for STIs usually consists of one of the following, depending on the infection:\n\n    \n    Antibiotics. Antibiotics, often in a single dose, can cure many sexually transmitted bacterial and parasitic infections, including gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. Typically, you'll be treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia at the same time because the two infections often appear together.\n    Once you start antibiotic treatment, it's necessary to follow through. If you don't think you'll be able to take medication as prescribed, tell your doctor. A shorter, simpler course of treatment may be available.\n    In addition, it's important to abstain from sex until seven days after you've completed antibiotic treatment and any sores have healed. Experts also suggest women be retested in about three months because there's high chance of reinfection.\n    \n    \n    Antiviral drugs. If you have herpes or HIV, you'll be prescribed an antiviral drug. You'll have fewer herpes recurrences if you take daily suppressive therapy with a prescription antiviral drug. However, it's still possible to give your partner herpes.\n    Antiviral drugs can keep HIV infection in check for many years. But you will still carry the virus and can still transmit it, though the risk is lower.\n    The sooner you start treatment, the more effective it is. If you take your medications exactly as directed, it's possible to reduce your virus count so low that it can hardly be detected.\n    \n\nIf you've had an STI, ask your doctor how long after treatment you need to be retested. Getting retested will ensure that the treatment worked and that you haven't been reinfected.\n        \n            \n            Partner notification and preventive treatmentIf tests show that you have an STI, your sex partners \u2014 including your current partners and any other partners you've had over the last three months to one year \u2014 need to be informed so that they can get tested. If they're infected, they can then be treated.\nEach state has different requirements, but most states require that certain STIs be reported to the local or state health department. Public health departments often employ trained disease intervention specialists who can help notify partners and refer people for treatment.\nOfficial, confidential partner notification can help limit the spread of STIs, particularly for syphilis and HIV. The practice also steers those at risk toward counseling and the right treatment. And since you can contract some STIs more than once, partner notification reduces your risk of getting reinfected.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Serotonin plays a role in regulating your digestive process, blood flow and breathing.\nAlthough it's possible that taking just one drug that increases serotonin levels can cause serotonin syndrome in susceptible individuals, this condition occurs most often when you combine certain medications.\nFor example, serotonin syndrome may occur if you take an antidepressant with a migraine medication. It may also occur if you take an antidepressant with an opioid pain medication.\nAnother cause of serotonin syndrome is intentional overdose of antidepressant medications.\nA number of over-the-counter and prescription drugs may be associated with serotonin syndrome, especially antidepressants. Illicit drugs and dietary supplements also may be associated with the condition.\nThe drugs and supplements that could potentially cause serotonin syndrome include:\n\n    Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antidepressants such as citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem), fluvoxamine, paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva, Brisdelle) and sertraline (Zoloft)\n    Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), antidepressants such as duloxetine (Cymbalta, Drizalma Sprinkle) and venlafaxine (Effexor XR)\n    Bupropion (Zyban, Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL), an antidepressant and tobacco-addiction medication\n    Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline (Pamelor)\n    Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), antidepressants such as isocarboxazid (Marplan) and phenelzine (Nardil)\n    Anti-migraine medications, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol, Carbatrol, others), valproic acid (Depakene) and triptans, which include almotriptan, naratriptan (Amerge) and sumatriptan (Imitrex, Tosymra, others)\n    Pain medications, such as opioid pain medications including codeine, fentanyl (Duragesic, Abstral, others), hydrocodone (Hysingla ER, Zohydro ER), meperidine (Demerol), oxycodone (Oxycontin, Roxicodone, others) and tramadol (Ultram, ConZip)\n    Lithium (Lithobid), a mood stabilizer\n    Illicit drugs, including LSD, ecstasy, cocaine and amphetamines\n    Herbal supplements, including St. John's wort, ginseng and nutmeg\n    Over-the-counter cough and cold medications containing dextromethorphan (Delsym)\n    Anti-nausea medications such as granisetron (Sancuso, Sustol), metoclopramide (Reglan), droperidol (Inapsine) and ondansetron (Zofran, Zuplenz)\n    Linezolid (Zyvox), an antibiotic\n    Ritonavir (Norvir), an anti-retroviral medication used to treat HIV\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "No single test can confirm a serotonin syndrome diagnosis.

Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium, Diastat) or lorazepam (Ativan), can help control agitation, seizures and muscle stiffness.\n    Serotonin-production blocking agents. If other treatments aren't working, medications such as cyproheptadine can help by blocking serotonin production.\n    Oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids.

Genetics and environmental factors may play a role. VSDs can occur alone or with other congenital heart defects.\nDuring fetal development, a ventricular septal defect occurs when the muscular wall separating the heart into left and right sides (septum) fails to form fully between the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles).\nNormally, the right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs to get oxygen; the left side pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. A VSD allows oxygenated blood to mix with deoxygenated blood, causing increased blood pressure and increased blood flow in the lung arteries. This results in increased work for the heart and lungs.\nVSDs may be various sizes, and they can be present in several locations in the wall between the ventricles. There may be one or more VSD.\nIt's also possible to acquire a VSD later in life, usually after a heart attack or as a complication following certain heart procedures.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) often cause a heart murmur that your doctor can hear using a stethoscope. If your doctor hears a heart murmur or finds other signs or symptoms of a heart defect, he or she may order several tests including:\n\n    Echocardiogram. In this test, sound waves produce a video image of the heart. Doctors may use this test to diagnose a ventricular septal defect and determine its size, location and severity. It may also be used to see if there are any other heart problems. Echocardiography can be used on a fetus (fetal echocardiography).\n    Electrocardiogram (ECG). This test records the electrical activity of the heart through electrodes attached to the skin and helps diagnose heart defects or rhythm problems.\n    Chest X-ray. An X-ray image helps the doctor view the heart and lungs to see if the heart is enlarged and if the lungs have extra fluid.\n    Cardiac catheterization. In this test, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel at the groin or arm and guided through the blood vessels into the heart. Through cardiac catheterization, doctors can diagnose congenital heart defects and determine the function of the heart valves and chambers\n    Pulse oximetry.

After birth, your doctor may want to observe your baby and treat symptoms while waiting to see if the defect closes on its own.\nBabies who need surgical repair often have the procedure in their first year. Children and adults who have a medium or large ventricular septal defect or one that's causing significant symptoms may need surgery to close the defect.\nSome smaller ventricular septal defects are closed surgically to prevent complications related to their locations, such as damage to heart valves. Many people with small VSDs have productive lives with few related problems.\nBabies who have large VSDs or who tire easily during feeding may need extra nutrition to help them grow. Some babies may require medication to help treat heart failure.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsMedications for ventricular septal defect depend on the severity of heart failure symptoms. The goal of medication is to decrease the amount of fluid in circulation and in the lungs.

If you or your child is having surgery to repair a ventricular defect, consider having surgery performed by surgeons and cardiologists with training and expertise in conducting these procedures.\nProcedures to treat VSD may include:\n\n    Surgical repair. This procedure of choice in most cases usually involves open-heart surgery under general anesthesia. The surgery requires a heart-lung machine and an incision in the chest. The doctor uses a patch or stitches to close the hole.\n    Catheter procedure. Closing a ventricular septal defect during catheterization doesn't require opening the chest. Rather, the doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) into a blood vessel in the groin and guides it to the heart. The doctor then uses a specially sized mesh device to close the hole.\n\nAfter repair, your doctor will schedule regular medical follow-up to ensure that the ventricular septal defect remains closed and to look for signs of complications.

Anything that disrupts these communication pathways can lead to a seizure. Some types of seizure disorders may be caused by genetic mutations.\nThe most common cause of seizures is epilepsy. But not every person who has a seizure has epilepsy. Sometimes seizures may be caused or triggered by:\n\n    High fever, which can be associated with an infection such as meningitis\n    Lack of sleep\n    Flashing lights, moving patterns or other visual stimulants\n    Low blood sodium (hyponatremia), which can happen with diuretic therapy\n    Medications, such as certain pain relievers, antidepressants or smoking cessation therapies, that lower the seizure threshold\n    Head trauma that causes an area of bleeding in the brain\n    Abnormalities of the blood vessels in the brain\n    Autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis\n    Stroke\n    Brain tumor\n    Use of illegal or recreational drugs, such as amphetamines or cocaine\n    Alcohol misuse, during times of withdrawal or extreme intoxication\n    COVID-19 virus infection\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    EEG brain activity\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tEEG brain activity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEEG brain activity\n\t\t\t\tAn EEG records the electrical activity of your brain via electrodes affixed to your scalp.

The differences represent areas where blood flow increased during the seizure. Once identified, that location is fitted onto an MRI scan of the brain.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nAfter a seizure, your doctor will thoroughly review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to determine the cause of your seizure and evaluate how likely it is that you'll have another one.\nTests may include:\n\n    A neurological exam. Your doctor may evaluate your behavior, motor abilities and mental function to determine if you have a problem with your brain and nervous system.\n    Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check your blood sugar levels and look for signs of infections, genetic conditions or electrolyte imbalances.\n    Lumbar puncture. If your doctor suspects an infection as the cause of a seizure, you may need to have a sample of cerebrospinal fluid removed for testing.\n    An electroencephalogram (EEG). In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain, which shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. The EEG may reveal a pattern that tells doctors whether a seizure is likely to occur again. EEG testing may also help your doctor exclude other conditions that mimic epilepsy as a reason for your seizure. Depending on the details of your seizures, this test may be done at an outpatient visit in the clinic, overnight at home with an ambulatory device or over a few nights in the hospital.\n\nImaging tests may include:\n\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could lead to seizures.\n    Computerized tomography (CT). A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might cause a seizure, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts.\n    Positron emission tomography (PET). A PET scan uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities.\n    Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3D map of the blood flow activity in your brain that happens during a seizure. Doctors may also conduct a type of SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered with MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. This test is usually done in a hospital with overnight EEG recording.\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n (function() {\n    kWidget.embed({\"targetId\":\"kaltura-video-1_f823nlz6\",\"wid\":\"_1825021\",\"uiconf_id\":44373111,\"flashvars\":{\"IframeCustomPluginCss1\":\"/-/media/kcms/ux/css/kaltura-player.css\",\"localizationCode\":\"auto\",\"autoPlay\":false},\"cache_st\":20200805,\"entry_id\":\"1_f823nlz6\",\"readyCallback\": function(playerId) {var kdp = document.getElementById(playerId); kdp.addJsListener('doPlay', 'doPlayCallback'); window.inlineReadyCallbackCalled = playerId; }});\n  })();\n \n\nVideo: MRI\n\n\n\nShow transcript for video Video: MRI\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create clear and detailed cross-sectional images of your head and body.\nYou don't need to prepare for an MRI. Unless otherwise instructed, eat normally (before the procedure) and if you take medications, continue to do so. Once checked in, you'll likely change into a gown and robe.\n\nRemove all accessories, such as your watch, jewelry and hairpins. Also remove things like wigs, dentures and hearing aids. Tell your MRI technologist if you have metal or electronic devices in your body, because their presence may be a safety hazard. The magnet may disable your electronic device or affect the MR image quality.\n\nBefore your exam, the MRI technologist may confirm your health issues and answer any last-minute questions.\n\nMost MRI machines look like a big doughnut. A large magnet is housed within a circular structure. You'll lie down on a table that slides into the opening of the magnet. Depending on where you need magnetic resonance imaging, a small device called a coil may be placed around the body part being examined. The coil receives the magnetic resonance signal.\n\nYour technologist will monitor you from another room, but you can talk with him or her by microphone. In some cases, a friend or family member may stay with you. If you are especially anxious or have claustrophobia, you may be offered a mild sedative.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging is safe for children, and an adult may stay in the scanning room for reassurance. Young children, toddlers and infants may need sedation since they must remain still throughout the imaging process.\n\nThe exam itself is painless, but noisy. You don't feel the magnetic field or radio waves, and there are no moving parts to see. However, the magnet produces repetitive tapping and thumping sounds, so you'll likely be offered earplugs or special metal-free headphones to help block the noise. MRIs that require your head to be in the machine often include a mirror for you to see out.\n\nHere's how an MRI is created. Most machines use tube-shaped magnets. The strong magnetic field is produced by passing an electric current through wire loops inside of the magnet's protective housing. Other coils in the magnet send and receive radio waves.\n\nOnce you're positioned inside the magnet, some protons within your body will align with the magnetic field. This is harmless and you won't feel it happening.\n\nOnce aligned, these protons respond to low-power radio waves that stimulate signals from your body. The radio waves are generated by specialized radio frequency coils (RF coils), which are antennas designed for medical imaging.\n\nThe signal that your body returns is detected by the coils surrounding the specific body part targeted for imaging. A computer processes all the signals and reconstructs a highly detailed image.\nThe final picture is a composite, three-dimensional representation of your body. Any two-dimensional plane \u2014 or slice \u2014 can be electronically created and displayed on a computer for interpretation. These images can also be converted from the screen into photographic film for further study.\n\nAn MRI exam lasts between 30 and 90 minutes. Because movement can blur the resulting images, remain still and breathe quietly without moving your head or body.\n\nAlthough not shown in this video, contrast agents are sometimes injected into your veins to enhance the appearance of certain tissues or blood vessels.\n\nOnce your MRI is complete, you may be asked to wait until the images are reviewed to make sure that no additional imaging is necessary. If no further studies are required, you'll be released and can resume your regular activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your seizures-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationSeizures care at Mayo ClinicCT scanEEG (electroencephalogram)Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)MRIPositron emission tomography scanSPECT scanShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Vagus nerve stimulation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tVagus nerve stimulation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tVagus nerve stimulation\n\t\t\t\tIn vagus nerve stimulation, an implanted pulse generator and lead wire stimulate the vagus nerve, which leads to stabilization of abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Deep brain stimulation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDeep brain stimulation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDeep brain stimulation\n\t\t\t\tDeep brain stimulation involves implanting an electrode deep within your brain. The amount of stimulation delivered by the electrode is controlled by a pacemaker-like device placed under the skin in your chest. A wire that travels under your skin connects the device to the electrode.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nNot everyone who has one seizure will have another one, and because a seizure can be an isolated incident, your doctor may not decide to start treatment until you've had more than one.\nThe optimal goal in seizure treatment is to find the best possible therapy to stop seizures, with the fewest side effects.\n        \n            \n            MedicationTreatment for seizures often involves the use of anti-seizure medications. There are many different options for anti-seizure medication. One of the more recent medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration, cannabidiol (Epidiolex), is derived from marijuana. It's approved to treat certain seizures in children age 2 and older.\nThe goal of medication is to find the medicine that works best for you and that causes the fewest side effects. In some cases, your doctor might recommend more than one medication.\nFinding the right medication and dosage can be complex. You may need to try several different medications to find out which best controls your seizures with the fewest side effects. Side effects may include weight gain, dizziness, fatigue and mood changes. More-serious side effects can cause damage to the liver or bone marrow.\nYour doctor will consider your condition, your frequency of seizures, your age and other factors when choosing which medication to prescribe. Your doctor will also review any other medications you may be taking, to ensure that the anti-epileptic medications won't interact with them.\n        \n            \n            Dietary therapyFollowing a diet that's high in fat and very low in carbohydrates, known as a ketogenic diet, can improve seizure control. The ketogenic diet is very strict and can be challenging to follow, as there is a limited range of foods allowed. Variations on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, such as the low glycemic index and modified Atkins diets, though less effective, aren't as restrictive as the ketogenic diet and may provide benefit. These modified diets are still being studied.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryIf other treatments aren't effective, surgery may be an option. The goal of surgery is to stop seizures from happening. Surgery works best for people who have seizures that always originate in the same place in the brain. There are several types of surgery, including:\n\n    Lobectomy (lesionectomy). Surgeons locate and remove the area of your brain where seizures begin.\n    Multiple subpial transection. This type of surgery involves making several cuts in areas of the brain to prevent seizures. It's usually done when the area of the brain where seizures start can't be safely removed.\n    Corpus callosotomy. This surgery cuts the network of connections between the neurons of the right and left halves of the brain. This is used to treat seizures that start in one half of the brain and travel to the other half. However, even after surgery, seizures may still occur on the side of the brain where they started.\n    Hemispherectomy (hemispherotomy). This surgery removes half of the outer layer of the brain. This is an extreme type of surgery that is only used when medications aren't effective in managing seizures and seizures affect only half of the brain. Many daily functional abilities may be lost after this surgery, but children can often recover those abilities with significant rehabilitation.\n    Thermal ablation (laser interstitial thermal therapy). This less invasive surgical procedure focuses highly concentrated energy at a specific target in the brain where seizures begin and destroys the brain cells that cause seizures.\n\n        \n            \n            Electrical stimulationOther procedures that may offer seizure relief include:\n\n    Vagus nerve stimulation. A device implanted underneath the skin of your chest stimulates the vagus nerve in your neck, sending signals to your brain that inhibit seizures. With vagus nerve stimulation, you may still need to take medication, but you may be able to lower the dose.\n    Responsive neurostimulation. During responsive neurostimulation, a device implanted on the surface of your brain or within brain tissue can detect seizure activity and deliver an electrical stimulation to the detected area to stop the seizure.\n    Deep brain stimulation. Doctors implant electrodes within certain areas of your brain to produce electrical impulses that regulate abnormal brain activity. The electrodes attach to a pacemaker-like device placed under the skin of your chest, which controls the amount of stimulation produced.\n\n        \n            \n            Pregnancy and seizuresWomen who've had previous seizures typically are able to have healthy pregnancies. Birth defects related to certain medications can sometimes occur.\nIn particular, valproic acid \u2014 one possible medication for generalized seizures \u2014 has been associated with cognitive deficits and neural tube defects, such as spina bifida. The American Academy of Neurology recommends that women avoid using valproic acid during pregnancy because of risks to their babies. Discuss these risks with your doctor. Because of the risk of birth defects and because pregnancy can alter medication levels, preconception planning is particularly important for women who've had seizures.\nIn some cases, it may be appropriate to change the dose of seizure medication before or during pregnancy. Women should work closely with their doctors before becoming pregnant with the goal of being on the lowest necessary dose of the safest seizure medication that is effective for seizure control.\n        \n            \n            Contraception and anti-seizure medicationsSome anti-seizure medications can alter the effectiveness of birth control (oral contraceptive) medication. If contraception is a high priority, check with your doctor to evaluate whether your medication interacts with your oral contraceptive, and if other forms of contraception need to be considered.\n\n\n

{"Diseases": "Temporal lobe seizure", "Symptoms": "An unusual sensation (aura) may precede a temporal lobe seizure, acting as a warning. Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures has auras, and not everyone who has auras remembers them.\nThe aura is actually the first part of a focal seizure before consciousness is impaired. Examples of auras include:\n\n    A sudden sense of unprovoked fear or joy\n    A deja vu experience \u2014 a feeling that what's happening has happened before\n    A sudden or strange odor or taste\n    A rising sensation in the abdomen, similar to being on a roller coaster\n\nSometimes temporal lobe seizures impair your ability to respond to others. This type of temporal lobe seizure usually lasts 30 seconds to two minutes. Characteristic signs and symptoms include:\n\n    Loss of awareness of surroundings\n    Staring\n    Lip smacking\n    Repeated swallowing or chewing\n    Unusual finger movements, such as picking motions\n\nAfter a temporal lobe seizure, you may have:\n\n    A period of confusion and difficulty speaking\n    Inability to recall what occurred during the seizure\n    Unawareness of having had a seizure\n    Extreme sleepiness\n\nIn extreme cases, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure evolves into a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure \u2014 featuring convulsions and loss of consciousness.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorSeek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs:\n\n    The seizure lasts more than five minutes.\n    Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops.\n    A second seizure follows immediately.\n    Recovery isn't complete after the seizure is over.\n    Recovery is slower than usual after the seizure is over.\n    You have a high fever.\n    You're experiencing heat exhaustion.\n    You're pregnant.\n    You have diabetes.\n    You've injured yourself during the seizure.\n\nIf you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice.\nSeek medical advice in these circumstances:\n\n    If you think you or your child is having seizures\n    When the number or severity

contains four lobes. The frontal lobe is important for cognitive functions and control of voluntary movement or activity. The parietal lobe processes information about temperature, taste, touch and movement, while the occipital lobe is primarily responsible for vision. The temporal lobe processes memories, integrating them with sensations of taste, sound, sight and touch.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOften, the cause of temporal lobe seizures remains unknown. However, they can be a result of a number of factors, including:\n\n    Traumatic brain injury\n    Infections, such as encephalitis or meningitis, or a history of such infections\n    A process that causes scarring (gliosis) in a part of the temporal lobe called the hippocampus\n    Blood vessel malformations in the brain\n    Stroke\n    Brain tumors\n    Genetic syndromes\n\nDuring normal waking and sleeping, your brain cells produce varying electrical activity. If the electrical activity in many brain cells becomes abnormally synchronized, a convulsion or seizure may occur.\nIf this happens in just one area of the brain, the result is a focal seizure. A temporal lobe seizure is a focal seizure that originates in one of the temporal lobes.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    EEG brain activity\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tEEG brain activity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEEG brain activity\n\t\t\t\tAn EEG records the electrical activity of your brain via electrodes affixed to your scalp.

Once identified, that location is fitted onto an MRI scan of the brain.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nAfter a seizure, your doctor will thoroughly review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to determine the cause of your seizure and evaluate how likely it is that you'll have another one.\nTests may include:\n\n    Neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities and mental function to determine if you have a problem with your brain and nervous system.\n    Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions, blood sugar levels or electrolyte imbalances.\n    Electroencephalogram (EEG). Electrodes attached to your scalp record the electrical activity of your brain, which shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. The EEG may reveal a pattern that tells doctors whether a seizure is likely to occur again, or help rule out other conditions that mimic epilepsy.\n    Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might cause a seizure, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts.\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could lead to seizures.\n    Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities.\n    Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain that happens during a seizure. Doctors may also conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to magnetic resonance imaging (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results.\nMore InformationEEG (electroencephalogram)MRISPECT scan\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Not everyone who has one seizure will have another one. Because a seizure can be an isolated incident, your doctor may not decide to start treatment until you've had more than one.\nThe optimal goal in seizure treatment is to find the best possible therapy to stop seizures, with the fewest side effects.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsMany medications are available to treat temporal lobe seizures. However, many people don't achieve seizure control with medications alone, and side effects, including fatigue, weight gain and dizziness, are common.\nDiscuss possible side effects with your doctor when deciding about treatment options. Also ask what effect your seizure medications and other medications you take, such as oral contraceptives, may have on each other.\n        \n            \n            Surgical or other procedures\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Vagus nerve stimulation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tVagus nerve stimulation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tVagus nerve stimulation\n\t\t\t\tIn vagus nerve stimulation, an implanted pulse generator and lead wire stimulate the vagus nerve, which leads to stabilization of abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Deep brain stimulation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDeep brain stimulation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDeep brain stimulation\n\t\t\t\tDeep brain stimulation involves implanting an electrode deep within your brain. The amount of stimulation delivered by the electrode is controlled by a pacemaker-like device placed under the skin in your chest. A wire that travels under your skin connects the device to the electrode.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nWhen anti-seizure medications aren't effective, other treatments may be an option:\n\n    \n    Surgery. The goal of surgery is to stop seizures from happening. This is often done through a traditional surgery, where surgeons operate to remove the area of the brain where seizures begin. In certain people, surgeons may be able to use MRI-guided laser therapy as a less invasive way to destroy the area of damaged tissue that causes seizures.\n    Surgery works best for people who have seizures that always originate in the same place in their brains. Surgery generally isn't an option if your seizures come from more than one area of the brain, your seizure focus can't be identified or your seizures come from a region of the brain that performs vital functions.\n    \n    Vagus nerve stimulation. A device implanted underneath the skin of your chest stimulates the vagus nerve in your neck, sending signals to your brain that inhibit seizures. With vagus nerve stimulation, you may still need to take medication, but you may be able to lower the dose.\n    Responsive neurostimulation. During responsive neurostimulation, a device implanted on the surface of your brain or within brain tissue can detect seizure activity and deliver an electrical stimulation to the detected area to stop the seizure.\n    Dietary therapy. Following a diet that's high in fat and low in carbohydrates, known as a ketogenic diet, can improve seizure control. Variations on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, such as the low glycemic index and modified Atkins diets, may be less effective. However, they aren't as restrictive as the ketogenic diet and might provide some benefit.\n\n        \n            \n            Pregnancy and seizuresWomen who've had previous seizures typically are able to have healthy pregnancies. Birth defects related to certain medications can sometimes occur.\nIn particular, valproic acid (Depakene) \u2014 one possible medication for generalized seizures \u2014 has been associated with cognitive deficits and neural tube defects, such as spina bifida. The American Academy of Neurology recommends that women avoid using valproic acid during pregnancy because of risks to the baby.\nDiscuss these risks with your doctor. Because of the risk of birth defects, and because pregnancy can alter medication levels, preconception planning is particularly important for women who've had seizures.\nIn some cases, it may be appropriate to change the dose of seizure medication before or during pregnancy.

Some conditions require prompt treatment to avoid permanent damage to a testicle.\n\nSee your doctor if you detect a lump in your scrotum, even if it's not painful or tender, or if you experience other symptoms of a scrotal mass.\n\nSome scrotal masses are more common in children. See your doctor if your child experiences symptoms of a scrotal mass, if you have any concerns about the development of the genitals or if a testicle is \u201cmissing\u201d \u2014 an undescended or retractile testicle, which might increase the risk of some scrotal masses later in life.\n\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Spermatocele\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSpermatocele\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tSpermatocele\r\n\t\t\t\tA spermatocele, also known as a spermatic cyst, is a typically painless, noncancerous (benign), fluid-filled sac that grows near the top of a testicle.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Hydrocele\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tHydrocele\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tHydrocele\r\n\t\t\t\tHydrocele is the type of scrotal swelling that occurs when fluid collects in the thin sheath that surrounds the testicle.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Varicocele\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVaricocele\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tVaricocele\r\n\t\t\t\tA varicocele is an enlargement of the veins that transport oxygen-depleted blood away from the testicle.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Inguinal hernia\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tInguinal hernia\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tInguinal hernia\r\n\t\t\t\tInguinal hernias occur when part of the membrane lining the abdominal cavity (omentum) or intestine protrudes through a weak spot in the abdomen \u2014 often along the inguinal canal, which carries the spermatic cord in men.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of disorders can result in a scrotal mass or an abnormality in the scrotum, including:\n\nTesticular cancer. Testicular cancer is a tumor containing abnormal testicular tissue, which can usually be felt as a nontender lump in the scrotum.\nSome men experience pain and swelling, but most tumors don't cause symptoms. See your doctor if you notice any new lump in your scrotum.\n\nSpermatocele. Also known as a spermatic cyst or epididymal cyst, spermatocele is a typically painless, noncancerous (benign), fluid-filled sac in the scrotum, usually above the testicle.\n\nEpididymitis. This is inflammation of the epididymis, the comma-shaped structure above and behind the testicle that stores and transports sperm.\n\nEpididymitis is often caused by a bacterial infection, including sexually transmitted bacterial infections, such as chlamydia. Less commonly, epididymitis is caused by a viral infection or an abnormal flow of urine into the epididymis.\n\nOrchitis. This is inflammation of the testicle usually due to a viral infection \u2014 most commonly mumps. When orchitis is caused by a bacterial infection, the epididymis also might be infected.\n\nHydrocele. Hydrocele occurs when there is excess fluid between the layers of a sac that surrounds each testicle. A small amount of fluid in this space is normal, but the excess fluid of a hydrocele usually results in a painless swelling of the scrotum.\n\nIn infants, a hydrocele occurs usually because an opening between the abdomen and the scrotum hasn't properly sealed during development.\n\nIn adults, a hydrocele occurs usually because of an imbalance in the production or absorption of fluid, often as a result of injury or infection in the scrotum.\n\nHematocele. Hematocele occurs where there is blood between the layers of a sac that surrounds each testicle. Traumatic injury, such as a direct blow to the testicles, is the most likely cause.\n\nVaricocele. This is the enlargement of the veins within the scrotum that carry oxygen-depleted blood from each testicle and the epididymis. Varicocele is more common on the left side of the scrotum because of differences in how blood circulates from each side.\n\nA varicocele might cause infertility.\n\nInguinal hernia. This is a condition in which a portion of the small intestine pushes through an opening or weak spot in the tissue separating the abdomen and groin.\n\nIn infants, an inguinal hernia usually occurs because the passageway from the abdomen to the scrotum has failed to close during development.\n\nAn inguinal hernia might appear as a mass in the scrotum or higher in the groin.\n\nTesticular torsion. This is a twisting of the spermatic cord, the bundle of blood vessels, nerves and the tube that carries semen from the testicle to the penis.\n\nThis painful condition cuts off blood to the testicle and can result in the loss of the testicle if not promptly treated. The affected testicle might be sideways, enlarged and higher than normal.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will rely on a number of factors to diagnose a scrotal mass. These may include:\n\nA physical exam. Your doctor will feel your scrotum, its contents and nearby areas of the groin while you're standing and lying down.\nTransillumination. Shining a bright light through the scrotum might provide information about the size, location and makeup of a scrotal mass.\nUltrasound. Using sound waves to create an image of internal organs, this test can provide detailed information about the size, location and makeup of a scrotal mass, as well as the condition of the testicles. An ultrasound usually is necessary to diagnose a scrotal mass.\nUrine test. Laboratory tests of a sample of urine might detect a bacterial or viral infection or the presence of blood or pus in the urine.\nBlood test. Laboratory tests of a blood sample might detect a bacterial or viral infection or elevated levels of certain proteins that are associated with testicular cancer.\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan. If other tests indicate testicular cancer, you'll likely undergo a specialized X-ray exam (CT scan) of your chest, abdomen and groin to see if cancer has spread to other tissues or organs.\nMore InformationCT scanUltrasoundUrinalysis\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Most scrotal masses require minimally invasive or no treatment, but some require medicine or more-serious procedures.\n        \n            \n            InfectionsScrotal masses caused by a bacterial infection, as is usually the case with epididymitis, are treated with antibiotics. Viral infections causing epididymitis or orchitis are usually treated with rest, ice and pain relief medication.\n        \n            \n            Noncancerous (benign) scrotal massesBenign scrotal masses might be left untreated or surgically removed, repaired, or drained. These treatment decisions depend on factors such as whether the scrotal mass:\nCauses discomfort or pain\nContributes to or increases the risk of infertility\nBecomes infected\n        \n            \n            Testicular cancerA specialist in cancer treatment (oncologist) will recommend treatments based on whether the cancer is isolated to a testicle or has spread to other tissues in the body. Your age and overall health also are factors in choosing treatment options for testicular cancer.\n\nRadical inguinal orchiectomy. This is the primary treatment for testicular cancer. It's a surgical procedure to remove the affected testicle and spermatic cord through an incision in the groin.

{"Diseases": "Scleroderma", "Symptoms": "Scleroderma's signs and symptoms vary, depending on which parts of your body are affected:\n\n    Skin. Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of patches of skin. These patches may be shaped like ovals or straight lines, or cover wide areas of the trunk and limbs. The number, location and size of the patches vary by type of scleroderma. Skin can appear shiny because it's so tight, and movement of the affected area may be restricted.\n    Fingers or toes. One of the earliest signs of systemic scleroderma is Raynaud's disease, which causes the small blood vessels in your fingers and toes to contract in response to cold temperatures or emotional distress. When this happens, your fingers or toes may turn blue or feel painful or numb. Raynaud's disease also occurs in people who don't have scleroderma.\n    Digestive system. Scleroderma can cause a variety of digestive symptoms, depending on which part of the digestive tract is affected. If the esophagus is affected, you might have heartburn or difficulty swallowing. If the intestines are affected, you might have cramps, bloating, diarrhea or constipation. Some people who have scleroderma may also have problems absorbing nutrients if their intestinal muscles aren't properly moving food through the intestines.\n    Heart, lungs or kidneys.

It may also result from a gunshot or knife wound that penetrates and cuts your spinal cord.\nAdditional damage usually occurs over days or weeks because of bleeding, swelling, inflammation and fluid accumulation in and around your spinal cord.\nA nontraumatic spinal cord injury may be caused by arthritis, cancer, inflammation, infections or disk degeneration of the spine.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Your brain and central nervous systemThe central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. The spinal cord, made of soft tissue and surrounded by bones (vertebrae), extends downward from the base of your brain and is made up of nerve cells and groups of nerves called tracts, which go to different parts of your body.\nThe lower end of your spinal cord stops a little above your waist in the region called the conus medullaris. Below this region is a group of nerve roots called the cauda equina.\nTracts in your spinal cord carry messages between your brain and the rest of your body. Motor tracts carry signals from your brain to control muscle movement. Sensory tracts carry signals from body parts to your brain relating to heat, cold, pressure, pain and the position of your limbs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Damage to nerve fibersWhether the cause is traumatic or nontraumatic, the damage affects the nerve fibers passing through the injured area and may impair part or all of your corresponding muscles and nerves below the injury site.\n\nA chest (thoracic) or lower back (lumbar) injury can affect your torso, legs, bowel and bladder control, and sexual function. A neck (cervical) injury affects the same areas in addition to affecting movements of your arms and, possibly, your ability to breathe.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Common causes of spinal cord injuriesThe most common causes of spinal cord injuries in the United States are:\n\n    Motor vehicle accidents. Auto and motorcycle accidents are the leading cause of spinal cord injuries, accounting for almost half of new spinal cord injuries each year.\n    Falls. A spinal cord injury after age 65 is most often caused by a fall. Overall, falls cause about 31% of spinal cord injuries.\n    Acts of violence. Over 13% of spinal cord injuries result from violent encounters, most commonly involving gunshot wounds. Knife wounds also are common.\n    Sports and recreation injuries. Athletic activities, such as impact sports and diving in shallow water, cause about 10% of spinal cord injuries.\n    Alcohol. Alcohol use is a factor in about 1 out of every 4 spinal cord injuries.\n    Diseases. Cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis and inflammation of the spinal cord also can cause spinal cord injuries.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "In the emergency room, a doctor may be able to rule out a spinal cord injury by careful inspection and examination, testing for sensory function and movement, and by asking some questions about the accident.\n\nBut if the injured person complains of neck pain, isn't fully awake, or has obvious signs of weakness or neurological injury, emergency diagnostic tests may be needed.\n\nThese tests may include:\n\n\nX-rays. Medical personnel typically order these tests on people who are suspected of having a spinal cord injury after trauma. X-rays can reveal vertebral (spinal column) problems, tumors, fractures or degenerative changes in the spine.\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan may provide a better look at abnormalities seen on an X-ray. This scan uses computers to form a series of cross-sectional images that can define bone, disk and other problems.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce computer-generated images. This test is very helpful for looking at the spinal cord and identifying herniated disks, blood clots or other masses that may be compressing the spinal cord.\n\n\nA few days after injury, when some of the swelling may have subsided, your doctor will conduct a more comprehensive neurological exam to determine the level and completeness of your injury. This involves testing your muscle strength and your ability to sense light touch and pinprick sensations.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your spinal cord injury-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationSpinal cord injury care at Mayo ClinicCT scanMRIX-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Unfortunately, there's no way to reverse damage to the spinal cord. But researchers are continually working on new treatments, including prostheses and medications that may promote nerve cell regeneration or improve the function of the nerves that remain after a spinal cord injury.\n\nIn the meantime, spinal cord injury treatment focuses on preventing further injury and empowering people with a spinal cord injury to return to an active and productive life.\n\n        \n            \n            Emergency actionsUrgent medical attention is critical to minimize the effects of any head or neck trauma. Therefore, treatment for a spinal cord injury often begins at the scene of the accident.\n\nEmergency personnel typically immobilize the spine as gently and quickly as possible using a rigid neck collar and a rigid carrying board, which they'll use to transport you to the hospital.\n\n        \n            \n            Early (acute) stages of treatmentIn the emergency room, doctors focus on:\n\n    Maintaining your ability to breathe\n    Preventing shock\n    Immobilizing your neck to prevent further spinal cord damage\n    Avoiding possible complications, such as stool or urine retention, respiratory or cardiovascular difficulty, and formation of deep vein blood clots in the extremities\n\nIf you do have a spinal cord injury, you'll usually be admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment. You may even be transferred to a regional spine injury center that has a team of neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, spinal cord medicine specialists, psychologists, nurses, therapists and social workers with expertise in spinal cord injury.\n\n    Medications. Intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) has been used as a treatment option for an acute spinal cord injury in the past. But recent research has shown that the potential side effects, such as blood clots and pneumonia, from using this medication outweigh the benefits. Because of this, methylprednisolone is no longer recommended for routine use after a spinal cord injury.\n    Immobilization. You may need traction to stabilize your spine, to bring the spine into proper alignment or both. In some cases, a rigid neck collar may work. A special bed also may help immobilize your body.\n    Surgery. Often surgery is necessary to remove fragments of bones, foreign objects, herniated disks or fractured vertebrae that appear to be compressing the spine. Surgery may also be needed to stabilize the spine to prevent future pain or deformity.\n    Experimental treatments. Scientists are trying to figure out ways to stop cell death, control inflammation and promote nerve regeneration. For example, doctors may lower the body temperature significantly \u2014 a condition known as hypothermia \u2014 for 24 to 48 hours to help prevent damaging inflammation. Ask your doctor about the availability of such treatments.\n\n        \n            \n            Ongoing careAfter the initial injury or condition stabilizes, doctors turn their attention to preventing secondary problems that may arise, such as deconditioning, muscle contractures, pressure ulcers, bowel and bladder issues, respiratory infections, and blood clots.\nThe length of your hospitalization depends on your condition and the medical issues you're facing. Once you're well enough to participate in therapies and treatment, you may transfer to a rehabilitation facility.\n        \n            \n            RehabilitationRehabilitation team members will begin to work with you while you're in the early stages of recovery. Your team may include a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a rehabilitation nurse, a rehabilitation psychologist, a social worker, a dietitian, a recreation therapist, and a doctor who specializes in physical medicine (physiatrist) or spinal cord injuries.\nDuring the initial stages of rehabilitation, therapists usually emphasize maintenance and strengthening of existing muscle function, redeveloping fine motor skills, and learning adaptive techniques to accomplish day-to-day tasks.\nYou'll be educated on the effects of a spinal cord injury and how to prevent complications, and you'll be given advice on rebuilding your life and increasing your quality of life and independence.\nYou'll be taught many new skills, and you'll use equipment and technologies that can help you live on your own as much as possible. You'll be encouraged to resume your favorite hobbies, participate in social and fitness activities, and return to school or the workplace.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsMedications may be used to manage some of the effects of spinal cord injury. These include medications to control pain and muscle spasticity, as well as medications that can improve bladder control, bowel control and sexual functioning.\n        \n            \n            New technologiesInventive medical devices can help people with a spinal cord injury become more independent and more mobile. Some devices may also restore function. These include:\n\nModern wheelchairs. Improved, lighter weight wheelchairs are making people with spinal cord injuries more mobile and more comfortable. For some, an electric wheelchair may be needed. Some wheelchairs can even climb stairs, travel over rough terrain and elevate a seated passenger to eye level to reach high places without help.\nComputer adaptations. For someone who has limited hand function, computers can be very powerful tools, but they're difficult to operate. Computer adaptations range from simple to complex, such as key guards or voice recognition.\nElectronic aids to daily living. Essentially any device that uses electricity can be controlled with an electronic aid to daily living. Devices can be turned on or off by switch or voice-controlled and computer-based remotes.\nElectrical stimulation devices. These sophisticated devices use electrical stimulation to produce actions. They're often called functional electrical stimulation systems, and they use electrical stimulators to control arm and leg muscles to allow people with spinal cord injuries to stand, walk, reach and grip.\nRobotic gait training. This emerging technology is used for retraining walking ability after a spinal cord injury.\n\n        \n            \n            Prognosis and recoveryYour doctor may not be able to give you a prognosis right away. Recovery, if it occurs, typically starts a week to six months after an injury. The fastest rate of recovery is often seen in the first six months, but some people experience small improvements for up to one to two years.More InformationSpinal cord injury care at Mayo ClinicAssistive technology for spinal cord injuryDiaphragm pacing for spinal cord injuryFunctional electrical stimulation for spinal cord injuryLocomotor training for spinal cord injuryNeurogenic bladder and bowel managementSexuality and fertility management after spinal cord injurySpinal cord injury rehabilitationShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},
{"Diseases": "Schizophrenia", "Symptoms": "Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include:\n\n    Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.\n    Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.\n    Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad.\n    Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.\n    Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.\n\nSymptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present.\nIn men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Symptoms in teenagersSchizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize. This may be in part because some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are common for typical development during teen years, such as:\n\n    Withdrawal from friends and family\n    A drop in performance at school\n    Trouble sleeping\n    Irritability or depressed mood\n    Lack of motivation\n\nAlso, recreational substance use, such as marijuana, methamphetamines or LSD, can sometimes cause similar signs and symptoms.\nCompared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, teens may be:\n\n    Less likely to have delusions\n    More likely to have visual hallucinations\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorPeople with schizophrenia often lack awareness that their difficulties stem from a mental disorder that requires medical attention.

The full-team approach may be available in clinics with expertise in schizophrenia treatment.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsMedications are the cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment, and antipsychotic medications are the most commonly prescribed drugs. They're thought to control symptoms by affecting the brain neurotransmitter dopamine.\nThe goal of treatment with antipsychotic medications is to effectively manage signs and symptoms at the lowest possible dose. The psychiatrist may try different drugs, different doses or combinations over time to achieve the desired result. Other medications also may help, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs. It can take several weeks to notice an improvement in symptoms.\nBecause medications for schizophrenia can cause serious side effects, people with schizophrenia may be reluctant to take them. Willingness to cooperate with treatment may affect drug choice. For example, someone who is resistant to taking medication consistently may need to be given injections instead of taking a pill.\nAsk your doctor about the benefits and side effects of any medication that's prescribed.\n        \n            \n            Second-generation antipsychoticsThese newer, second-generation medications are generally preferred because they pose a lower risk of serious side effects than do first-generation antipsychotics.

Sometimes, this healing will occur naturally. In others, doctors may have to restore blood flow by opening the artery with a balloon or stent. Bypass surgery may also be used.\nThe treatments most appropriate for you will depend on your condition, including the size and location of the tear in the artery, as well as any signs or symptoms you're experiencing. Whenever possible, doctors allow the damaged artery to heal on its own, rather than repairing it using invasive procedures.\nFor some people, medications may relieve the symptoms of SCAD. In these situations, it may be possible to be treated by medications alone. If chest pain or other symptoms persist, other treatments may be needed.\n        \n            \n            Placing a stent to hold the artery openIf SCAD has blocked blood flow to your heart or if medications don't control your chest pain, your doctor may recommend placing a tiny mesh tube (stent) inside your artery to hold it open. A stent can help restore blood flow to your heart.\nTo position the stent, doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) into an artery \u2014 usually in your leg or arm \u2014 and guide the tube to the arteries in your heart. X-rays are used to help the doctor see where to place the catheter.\nA wire with a deflated balloon is passed through the catheter to the tear in the artery. The balloon is then inflated, expanding the stent against your artery walls. The stent is left in place to hold the artery open.\n        \n            \n            Surgery to bypass the damaged arteryIf other treatments haven't worked or if you have more than one tear in an artery, your doctor may recommend surgery to create a new way for blood to reach your heart.\nCoronary bypass surgery involves removing a blood vessel from another part of your body, such as your leg. That blood vessel is stitched into place so that it diverts blood flow around your damaged artery.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsAfter SCAD, your doctor may recommend medications, including:\n\n    Aspirin. Aspirin may help prevent cardiovascular disease problems after SCAD.\n    Blood-thinning drugs. Drugs that reduce the number of blood-clotting platelets in your blood (anticoagulants) can reduce the risk of a clot forming in the torn artery.\n    Blood pressure drugs. Drugs used to treat high blood pressure can lower your heart's demand for blood, reducing the pressure in your damaged artery. You may continue to take blood pressure drugs indefinitely to reduce the risk of another SCAD.\n    Medications to control chest pain. These medications (nitrates and calcium channel blockers) can help treat chest pain you may experience after SCAD.\n    Cholesterol drugs. People who have abnormal cholesterol levels and other risk factors may need to take medications to control their cholesterol levels.\n\n        \n            \n            Continuing careAfter your treatment for SCAD, you'll need regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to monitor for any changes in your condition. Your doctor may also recommend other types of care to help you recover and to prevent other health problems. These may include:\n\n    Undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation is a customized program of exercise and education designed to help you recover from a serious heart condition. Cardiac rehabilitation often includes monitored exercise, nutritional counseling, emotional support and education.\n    Reviewing your family medical history. Some inherited conditions, such as the connective tissue disease Marfan syndrome, have been found to occur in people who have had SCAD. Your doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor to review your family medical history and determine whether genetic testing may be appropriate for you.\n    Looking for weaknesses in other blood vessels. Your doctor may recommend using CT angiography to look for weaknesses and abnormalities in other blood vessels, such as FMD.\nMore InformationSpontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) care at Mayo ClinicCardiac rehabilitationCoronary angioplasty and stentsCoronary bypass surgerySCAD: A Disease-Specific, Social Networking Community-Initiated StudyShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

The small intestine is where food mixes with digestive juices and nutrients are absorbed into your bloodstream.\nUnlike your large intestine (colon), your small intestine normally has relatively few bacteria due to rapid flow of contents and the presence of bile. But in SIBO, stagnant food in the bypassed small intestine becomes an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. The bacteria may produce toxins as well as interfere with the absorption of nutrients. The breakdown products following bacterial digestion of food can also trigger diarrhea.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "In order to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), you may have tests to check for bacterial overgrowth in your small intestine, poor fat absorption, or other problems that may be causing or contributing to your symptoms. Common tests include:\n\n    Breath testing. This type of noninvasive test measures the amount of hydrogen or methane that you breathe out after drinking a mixture of glucose and water. A rapid rise in exhaled hydrogen or methane may indicate bacterial overgrowth in your small intestine. Although widely available, breath testing is less specific than other types of tests for diagnosing bacterial overgrowth.\n    Small intestine aspirate and fluid culture. This is currently the gold standard test for bacterial overgrowth. To obtain the fluid sample, doctors pass a long, flexible tube (endoscope) down your throat and through your upper digestive tract to your small intestine. A sample of intestinal fluid is withdrawn and then tested in a laboratory for the growth of bacteria.\n\nIn addition to these tests, your doctor may recommend blood testing to look for vitamin deficiency or a stool evaluation to test for fat malabsorption. In some cases, your doctor may recommend imaging tests, such as X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for structural abnormalities of the intestine.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Whenever possible, doctors treat SIBO by dealing with the underlying problem \u2014 for example, by surgically repairing a postoperative loop, stricture or fistula. But a loop can't always be reversed. In that case, treatment focuses on correcting nutritional deficiencies and eliminating bacterial overgrowth.\n        \n            \n            Antibiotic therapyFor most people, the initial way to treat bacterial overgrowth is with antibiotics. Doctors may start this treatment if your symptoms and medical history strongly suggest this is the cause, even when test results are inconclusive or without any testing at all. Testing may be performed if antibiotic treatment is not effective.\nA short course of antibiotics often significantly reduces the number of abnormal bacteria. But bacteria can return when the antibiotic is discontinued, so treatment may need to be long term. Some people with a loop in their small intestine may go for long periods without needing antibiotics, while others may need them regularly.\nDoctors may also switch among different antibiotics to help prevent bacterial resistance. Antibiotics wipe out most intestinal bacteria, both normal and abnormal. As a result, antibiotics can cause some of the very problems they're trying to cure, including diarrhea. Switching among different drugs can help avoid this problem.\n        \n            \n            Nutritional supportCorrecting nutritional deficiencies is a crucial part of treating SIBO, particularly in people with severe weight loss. Malnutrition can be treated, but the damage it causes can't always be reversed.\nThese treatments may improve vitamin deficiencies, reduce intestinal distress and help with weight gain:\n\n    Nutritional supplements. People with SIBO may need intramuscular injections of vitamin B-12, as well as oral vitamins, calcium and iron supplements.\n    \n    Lactose-free diet. Damage to the small intestine may cause you to lose the ability to digest milk sugar (lactose). In that case, it's important to avoid most lactose-containing products, or use lactase preparations that help digest milk sugar.\n    Some affected people may tolerate yogurt because the bacteria used in the culturing process naturally break down lactose.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

{"Diseases": "Sarcoma", "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of sarcoma include:\n\nA lump that can be felt through the skin that may or may not be painful\nBone pain\nA broken bone that happens unexpectedly, such as with a minor injury or no injury at all\nAbdominal pain\nWeight loss\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "It's not clear what causes most sarcomas.\n\nIn general, cancer forms when changes (mutations) happen in the DNA within cells. The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide.\n\nMutations might tell cells to grow and divide uncontrollably and to continue living when normal cells would die. If this happens, the accumulating abnormal cells can form a tumor. Cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Tests and procedures used to diagnose sarcoma and determine its extent (stage) include:\n\nA physical exam. Your doctor will likely do a physical exam to better understand your symptoms and look for other clues that will help with your diagnosis.\nImaging tests. Which imaging tests are right for you will depend on your situation. Some tests, such as X-rays, are better for seeing bone problems. Other tests, such as MRI, are better for seeing connective tissue problems. Other imaging tests might include ultrasound, CT, bone scans and positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\nRemoving a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). A biopsy is a procedure to remove a piece of suspicious tissue for lab testing. Sophisticated lab tests can determine whether the cells are cancerous and what kind of cancer they represent. Tests can also reveal information that's helpful for choosing the best treatments.\n\nHow a biopsy sample is collected depends on your particular situation. It could be removed with a needle passed through the skin or cut away during an operation. Sometimes a biopsy is done at the same time as surgery to remove the cancer.\n\nOnce your doctor determines you have sarcoma, he or she might recommend additional tests to look for signs that the cancer has spread.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your sarcoma-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Sarcoma is usually treated with surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments might be used before or after surgery. Which treatments are best for you will depend on the type of sarcoma, its location, how aggressive the cells are and whether cancer has spread to other parts of your body.\nTreatment for sarcoma might involve:\n\nSurgery. The goal of surgery for sarcoma is to remove all of the cancer cells. Sometimes it's necessary to amputate an arm or leg to remove all of the cancer, but surgeons try to preserve limb function when possible. Sometimes all of the cancer can't be removed without hurting important structures, such as nerves or organs. In these situations, the surgeons work to remove as much of the sarcoma as possible.\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. The radiation can come from a machine that moves around your body directing the beams of energy (external beam radiation). Or the radiation might be placed in your body temporarily (brachytherapy). Sometimes radiation is done during an operation to remove the cancer (intraoperative radiation).\nChemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells. Some types of sarcoma are more likely to respond to chemotherapy treatment than others.\nTargeted therapy. Targeted therapy is a drug treatment that uses medicines that attack specific weaknesses in cancer cells. Your doctor may have your sarcoma cells tested to see if they are likely to respond to targeted therapy drugs.\nImmunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a drug treatment that uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that blind the immune system cells. Immunotherapy drugs work by interfering with that process.\nAblation therapy. Ablation therapy treatments destroy cancer cells by applying electricity to heat the cells, very cold liquid to freeze the cells or high-frequency ultrasound waves to damage the cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

In his case, they were related to an autoimmune disease, sarcoidosis.\nDiana: The treatment, the doctors, the teamwork was unbelievable.\nLeslie Cooper, M.D.: We took an established drug in another area and applied it for the first time in cardiac sarcoidosis.\nDiana: It was experimental, but it put that sarcoid into remission and that gave Jim his life back. It turned out to be a really good risk.\nJim: I didn't realize that the Mayo Clinic was so accessible. When I go there I have no doubt that I'm going to meet competent people in their work and their field.  That, I think, gives you the confidence to trust that you are going to be okay.

Some people appear to have a genetic predisposition to develop the disease, which may be triggered by bacteria, viruses, dust or chemicals.\nThis triggers an overreaction of your immune system, and immune cells begin to collect in a pattern of inflammation called granulomas. As granulomas build up in an organ, the function of that organ can be affected.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Sarcoidosis can be difficult to diagnose because the disease often produces few signs and symptoms in its early stages. When symptoms do occur, they may mimic those of other disorders.\nYour doctor will likely start with a physical exam and discuss your symptoms. He or she will also listen carefully to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes for swelling, and examine any skin lesions.\nDiagnostic tests can help exclude other disorders and determine what body systems may be affected by sarcoidosis. Your doctor may recommend tests such as:\n\n    Blood and urine tests to assess your overall health and how well your kidneys and liver are functioning\n    Chest X-ray to check your lungs and heart\n    Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest to check your lungs\n    Lung (pulmonary) function tests to measure lung volume and how much oxygen your lungs deliver to your blood\n    Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) to detect heart problems and monitor the heart's status\n    Eye exam to check for vision problems that may be caused by sarcoidosis\n    Positron emission tomography (PET) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if sarcoidosis seems to be affecting your heart or central nervous system\n\nOther tests may be added, if needed.\n        \n            \n            BiopsiesYour doctor may order a small sample of tissue (biopsy) be taken from a part of your body believed to be affected by sarcoidosis to look for the granulomas commonly seen with the condition. For example, biopsies can be taken from your skin if you have skin lesions and from the lungs and lymph nodes if needed.More InformationCT scanSkin biopsyX-ray\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "There's no cure for sarcoidosis, but in many cases, it goes away on its own.

The severity and extent of your condition will determine whether and what type of treatment is needed.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsIf your symptoms are severe or organ function is threatened, you will likely be treated with medications. These may include:\n\n    Corticosteroids. These powerful anti-inflammatory drugs are usually the first line treatment for sarcoidosis. In some cases, corticosteroids can be applied directly to an affected area \u2014 via a cream to a skin lesion or drops to the eyes.\n    Medications that suppress the immune system. Medications such as methotrexate (Trexall) and azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) reduce inflammation by suppressing the immune system.\n    Hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) may be helpful for skin lesions and elevated blood-calcium levels.\n    Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors. These medications are commonly used to treat the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. They can also be helpful in treating sarcoidosis that hasn't responded to other treatments.\n\nOther medications may be used to treat specific symptoms or complications.\n        \n            \n            Other treatmentsDepending on your symptoms or complications, other treatments may be recommended. For example, you may have physical therapy to reduce fatigue and improve muscle strength, pulmonary rehabilitation to decrease respiratory symptoms, or an implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator for heart arrhythmias.\n        \n            \n            Ongoing monitoringHow often you see your doctor can vary based on your symptoms and treatment. Seeing your doctor regularly is important \u2015 even if you don't need treatment.\nYour doctor will monitor your symptoms, determine the effectiveness of treatments and check for complications. Monitoring may include regular tests based on your condition. For example, you may have regular chest X-rays, lab and urine tests, EKGs, and exams of the lungs, eyes, skin and any other organ involved. Follow-up care may be lifelong.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryOrgan transplant may be considered if sarcoidosis has severely damaged your lungs, heart or liver.More InformationLiver transplantLung transplant\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Feces may get onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process. Seafood may be contaminated if harvested from contaminated water.\n    Raw eggs. While an egg's shell may seem to be a perfect barrier to contamination, some infected chickens produce eggs that contain salmonella before the shell is even formed. Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.\n    Fruits and vegetables. Some fresh produce, particularly imported varieties, may be hydrated in the field or washed during processing with water contaminated with salmonella.

Their cause isn't clear.\nSalivary gland tumors begin when some cells in a salivary gland develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do.\nThe changes tell the cells to grow and divide rapidly. The abnormal cells go on living when healthy cells would die. The accumulating cells form a tumor.\nIf additional changes happen in the DNA, the abnormal cells may become cancerous. Cancer cells can invade and destroy nearby tissue. They can also break away from the tumor and spread (metastasize) to distant areas of the body.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Types of salivary gland tumorsMany different types of salivary gland tumors exist. Doctors classify salivary gland tumors based on the type of cells involved in the tumors. Knowing the type of salivary gland tumor you have helps your doctor determine which treatment options are best for you.\nTypes of noncancerous (benign) salivary gland tumors include:\n\n    Pleomorphic adenoma\n    Basal cell adenoma\n    Canalicular adenoma\n    Oncocytoma\n    Warthin tumor\n\nTypes of cancerous (malignant) salivary gland tumors include:\n\n    Acinic cell carcinoma\n    Adenocarcinoma\n    Adenoid cystic carcinoma\n    Clear cell carcinoma\n    Malignant mixed tumor\n    Mucoepidermoid carcinoma\n    Oncocytic carcinoma\n    Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma\n    Salivary duct carcinoma\n    Squamous cell carcinoma\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Tests and procedures used to diagnose salivary gland tumors include:\n\n    Physical exam. Your doctor will feel your jaw, neck and throat for lumps or swelling.\n    Imaging tests. Imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), ultrasound or X-ray, may help your doctor determine the size and location of your salivary gland tumor.\n    Collecting of a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). To collect a sample of tissue, your doctor may recommend a fine-needle aspiration or a core needle biopsy. During the biopsy, the doctor inserts a thin needle into the salivary gland to draw out a sample of suspicious cells. Doctors in a lab analyze the sample to determine what types of cells are involved and whether the cells are cancerous.\n\n        \n            \n            Determining the extent of salivary gland cancerIf you're diagnosed with salivary gland cancer, your doctor will determine the extent (stage) of your cancer. Your cancer's stage determines your treatment options and gives your doctor an idea of your prognosis.\nCancer stages are identified by Roman numerals, with stage I indicating a small, localized tumor and stage IV indicating an advanced cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or to distant parts of the body.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your salivary gland tumors-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationSalivary gland tumors care at Mayo ClinicCT scanMRINeedle biopsyShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for salivary gland tumors is usually with surgery to remove the tumor. People with salivary gland cancers may need additional treatments, such as with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\n        \n            \n            SurgerySurgery for salivary gland tumors may include:\n\n    Removing a portion of the affected salivary gland. If your tumor is small and located in an easy-to-access spot, your surgeon may remove the tumor and a small portion of healthy tissue that surrounds it.\n    Removing the entire salivary gland. If you have a larger tumor, your doctor may recommend removing the entire salivary gland. If your tumor extends into nearby structures \u2014 such as the facial nerves, the ducts that connect your salivary glands, facial bones and skin \u2014 these also may be removed.\n    Removing lymph nodes in your neck. Your surgeon may recommend removing some lymph nodes from your neck if your salivary gland tumor is cancerous and there's a risk that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. The surgeon removes the lymph nodes that are most likely to contain cancerous cells.\n    \n    Reconstructive surgery. After surgery to remove the tumor, your doctor may recommend reconstructive surgery to repair the area. If bone, skin or nerves are removed during your surgery, these may need to be repaired or replaced with reconstructive surgery.\n    During reconstructive surgery, the surgeon works to make repairs that improve your ability to chew, swallow, speak, breathe and move your face. You may need transfers of skin, tissue, bone or nerves from other parts of your body to rebuild areas in your mouth, face, throat or jaws.\n    \n\nSalivary gland surgery can be difficult because several important nerves are located in and around the glands. For example, a nerve in the face that controls facial movement runs through the parotid gland.\nRemoving tumors that involve important nerves may require stretching or cutting the nerves. This can cause partial or complete paralysis of your face (facial droop) that can be temporary or, in some situations, permanent. Surgeons take care to preserve these nerves whenever possible. Sometimes severed nerves can be repaired with nerves taken from other areas of your body or with processed nerve grafts from donors.\n        \n            \n            Radiation therapyIf you're diagnosed with salivary gland cancer, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine moves around you, directing high-powered beams at specific points on your body.\nA newer type of radiation therapy that uses particles called neutrons may be more effective in treating certain salivary gland cancers. More study is needed to understand the benefits and risks of this treatment. Neutron radiation therapy isn't widely available in the United States.\nRadiation therapy can be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain. If surgery isn't possible because a tumor is very large or is located in a place that makes removal too risky, your doctor may recommend radiation alone or in combination with chemotherapy.\n        \n            \n            ChemotherapyChemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses medications to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy isn't currently used as a standard treatment for salivary gland cancer, but researchers are studying its use.\nChemotherapy may be an option for people with advanced salivary gland cancer. It's sometimes used in combination with radiation therapy.\n        \n            \n            Supportive (palliative) carePalliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing other aggressive treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\nWhen palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer.\nPalliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families.

{"Diseases": "Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)", "Symptoms": "In most cases, seasonal affective disorder symptoms appear during late fall or early winter and go away during the sunnier days of spring and summer. Less commonly, people with the opposite pattern have symptoms that begin in spring or summer. In either case, symptoms may start out mild and become more severe as the season progresses.\nSigns and symptoms of SAD may include:\n\n    Feeling depressed most of the day, nearly every day\n    Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed\n    Having low energy\n    Having problems with sleeping\n    Experiencing changes in your appetite or weight\n    Feeling sluggish or agitated\n    Having difficulty concentrating\n    Feeling hopeless, worthless or guilty\n    Having frequent thoughts of death or suicide\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Fall and winter SADSymptoms specific to winter-onset SAD, sometimes called winter depression, may include:\n\n    Oversleeping\n    Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates\n    Weight gain\n    Tiredness or low energy\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Spring and summer SADSymptoms specific to summer-onset seasonal affective disorder, sometimes called summer depression, may include:\n\n    Trouble sleeping (insomnia)\n    Poor appetite\n    Weight loss\n    Agitation or anxiety\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Seasonal changes in bipolar disorderIn some people with bipolar disorder, spring and summer can bring on symptoms of mania or a less intense form of mania (hypomania), and fall and winter can be a time of depression.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorIt's normal to have some days when you feel down. But if you feel down for days at a time and you can't get motivated to do activities you normally enjoy, see your doctor. This is especially important if your sleep patterns and appetite have changed, you turn to alcohol for comfort or relaxation, or you feel hopeless or think about suicide. \r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The specific cause of seasonal affective disorder remains unknown. Some factors that may come into play include:\n\n    Your biological clock (circadian rhythm). The reduced level of sunlight in fall and winter may cause winter-onset SAD. This decrease in sunlight may disrupt your body's internal clock and lead to feelings of depression.\n    Serotonin levels. A drop in serotonin, a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) that affects mood, might play a role in SAD. Reduced sunlight can cause a drop in serotonin that may trigger depression.\n    Melatonin levels. The change in season can disrupt the balance of the body's level of melatonin, which plays a role in sleep patterns and mood.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Even with a thorough evaluation, it can sometimes be difficult for your doctor or mental health professional to diagnose seasonal affective disorder because other types of depression or other mental health conditions can cause similar symptoms.\nTo help diagnose SAD, your doctor or mental health professional may do a thorough evaluation, which generally includes:\n\n    Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and ask in-depth questions about your health. In some cases, depression may be linked to an underlying physical health problem.\n    Lab tests. For example, your doctor may do a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) or test your thyroid to make sure it's functioning properly.\n    Psychological evaluation. To check for signs of depression, your doctor or mental health professional asks about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions.\n    DSM-5. Your mental health professional may use the criteria for seasonal depressive episodes listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for seasonal affective disorder may include light therapy, medications and psychotherapy. If you have bipolar disorder, tell your doctor \u2014 this is critical to know when prescribing light therapy or an antidepressant. Both treatments can potentially trigger a manic episode.\n        \n            \n            Light therapyIn light therapy, also called phototherapy, you sit a few feet from a special light box so that you're exposed to bright light within the first hour of waking up each day. Light therapy mimics natural outdoor light and appears to cause a change in brain chemicals linked to mood.\nLight therapy is one of the first line treatments for fall-onset SAD. It generally starts working in a few days to a few weeks and causes few side effects. Research on light therapy is limited, but it appears to be effective for most people in relieving SAD symptoms.\nBefore you purchase a light box, talk with your doctor about the best one for you, and familiarize yourself with the variety of features and options so that you buy a high-quality product that's safe and effective. Also ask your doctor about how and when to use the light box.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsSome people with SAD benefit from antidepressant treatment, especially if symptoms are severe.\nAn extended-release version of the antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin XL, Aplenzin) may help prevent depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD. Other antidepressants also may commonly be used to treat SAD.\nYour doctor may recommend starting treatment with an antidepressant before your symptoms typically begin each year. He or she may also recommend that you continue to take the antidepressant beyond the time your symptoms normally go away.\nKeep in mind that it may take several weeks to notice full benefits from an antidepressant. In addition, you may have to try different medications before you find one that works well for you and has the fewest side effects.\n        \n            \n            PsychotherapyPsychotherapy, also called talk therapy, is another option to treat SAD. A type of psychotherapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy can help you:\n\n    Identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors that may be making you feel worse\n    Learn healthy ways to cope with SAD, especially with reducing avoidance behavior and scheduling activities\n    Learn how to manage stress\n\n        \n            \n            Mind-body connectionExamples of mind-body techniques that some people may choose to try to help cope with SAD include:\n\n    Relaxation techniques such as yoga or tai chi\n    Meditation\n    Guided imagery\n    Music or art therapy\nMore InformationLight therapyPsychotherapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Problems occur when part of the rotator cuff becomes irritated or damaged. This can result in pain, weakness and reduced range of motion.Sometimes one or more tendons become detached from the bone. In some cases, a surgeon can reattach the tendon to the bone using a thread-like material called a suture.But sometimes the tendon is too badly damaged to be reattached. In that case, the surgeon may consider a \"tendon transfer.\" This is a procedure in which a tendon from a different location is used to repair the rotator cuff.The tendon most commonly transferred is the latissimus dorsi tendon in the back. For a latissimus dorsi transfer, the surgeon makes two incisions: one in the back and one in the front of the shoulder.In the back, the surgeon detaches one end of a latissimus dorsi tendon and attaches a suture to that end. In the front, the surgeon creates a flap in the deltoid muscle, which covers the shoulder. He or she inserts a tool to grasp the end of the latissimus dorsi tendon. The surgeon brings the tendon under the deltoid to its new position.Sutures are used to connect the transferred tendon to any remaining rotator cuff as well as bone. The surgeon tightens the sutures to pull the tendon against the bone and ties it securely in place. In some cases, anchors are inserted into the bone to help hold the sutures in place.The surgeon closes the flap in the deltoid muscle.

Problems with the rotator cuff may cause weakness or pain and restrict movement. It may also cause damage to the shoulder joint.Often, tendons can be repaired. However, if the tendons are severely damaged, an operation called reverse shoulder replacement may be a better way to improve the joint's function and reduce pain, especially if the joint is affected by arthritis.This operation is also called reverse arthroplasty. \"Arthro\" means joint; \"plasty\" means to mold surgically.The top of the arm bone fits into a socket on the shoulder blade. In a typical shoulder replacement, a plastic lining is attached to the socket to allow smooth movement. The surgeon removes the top of the arm bone and inserts a metal stem with a ball on the end. However, if the rotator cuff is severely damaged, the joint may not be stable or work properly.In a reverse shoulder replacement, the normal ball-and-socket structure is reversed. An artificial ball is attached to the shoulder blade. An artificial socket is attached to the top of the arm bone. The large deltoid muscle that covers the shoulder is typically able to move the arm.General anesthesia will be given so you will sleep through the surgery.An incision or cut is made in the front of the arm and shoulder. The surgeon separates muscles and cuts through tissue to expose the joint.The upper arm bone is removed from the socket. The top of the arm bone is cut off and prepared to receive an artificial part. The socket is also prepared. A plate is screwed to the socket and a half-sphere attached. The metal stem is inserted in the arm bone, and a plastic socket is attached to the top.The new socket is fitted against the new ball to allow smooth movement. The tissue is sewn together around the joint, and the incision is closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMore InformationRotator cuff injury care at Mayo ClinicCortisone shotsReverse shoulder replacementRotator cuff: Tendon transferShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Dr. Poling says the tiny hairs in our inner ear may play a role.\n\n\"Those little hair cells in our inner ear are really delicate structures. That's what is actually damaged with noise exposure.\"\n\nDr. Poling says there's no scientifically proven cure for tinnitus, but there are treatment and management options.\n\n\"Something as simple as getting a hearing aid to really treat the hearing loss.\" Other options include using a sound generator or using a fan at night.\n\n\"There's something called 'tinnitus retraining therapy.'\" There are more ear-level masking devices where you can hear sounds throughout the day, too, that are more distracting.\"\n\nIf ringing in your ears bothers you, start by seeing your health care provider for a hearing test.\n\nFor the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Ian Roth.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "A number of health conditions can cause or worsen tinnitus. In many cases, an exact cause is never found.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Common causes of tinnitusIn many people, tinnitus is caused by one of the following:\n\n    \n    Hearing loss. There are tiny, delicate hair cells in your inner ear (cochlea) that move when your ear receives sound waves. This movement triggers electrical signals along the nerve from your ear to your brain (auditory nerve). Your brain interprets these signals as sound.\n    If the hairs inside your inner ear are bent or broken \u2014 this happens as you age or when you are regularly exposed to loud sounds \u2014 they can \"leak\" random electrical impulses to your brain, causing tinnitus.\n    \n    Ear infection or ear canal blockage. Your ear canals can become blocked with a buildup of fluid (ear infection), earwax, dirt or other foreign materials. A blockage can change the pressure in your ear, causing tinnitus.\n    Head or neck injuries. Head or neck trauma can affect the inner ear, hearing nerves or brain function linked to hearing. Such injuries usually cause tinnitus in only one ear.\n    \n    Medications. A number of medications may cause or worsen tinnitus. Generally, the higher the dose of these medications, the worse tinnitus becomes. Often the unwanted noise disappears when you stop using these drugs.\n    Medications known to cause tinnitus include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and certain antibiotics, cancer drugs, water pills (diuretics), antimalarial drugs and antidepressants.\n    \n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Other causes of tinnitusLess common causes of tinnitus include other ear problems, chronic health conditions, and injuries or conditions that affect the nerves in your ear or the hearing center in your brain.\n\n    Meniere's disease. Tinnitus can be an early indicator of Meniere's disease, an inner ear disorder that may be caused by abnormal inner ear fluid pressure.\n    Eustachian tube dysfunction. In this condition, the tube in your ear connecting the middle ear to your upper throat remains expanded all the time, which can make your ear feel full.\n    Ear bone changes. Stiffening of the bones in your middle ear (otosclerosis) may affect your hearing and cause tinnitus. This condition, caused by abnormal bone growth, tends to run in families.\n    Muscle spasms in the inner ear. Muscles in the inner ear can tense up (spasm), which can result in tinnitus, hearing loss and a feeling of fullness in the ear. This sometimes happens for no explainable reason, but can also be caused by neurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis.\n    Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Problems with the TMJ, the joint on each side of your head in front of your ears, where your lower jawbone meets your skull, can cause tinnitus.\n    Acoustic neuroma or other head and neck tumors. Acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops on the cranial nerve that runs from your brain to your inner ear and controls balance and hearing. Other head, neck or brain tumors can also cause tinnitus.\n    Blood vessel disorders. Conditions that affect your blood vessels \u2014 such as atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, or kinked or malformed blood vessels \u2014 can cause blood to move through your veins and arteries with more force. These blood flow changes can cause tinnitus or make tinnitus more noticeable.\n    Other chronic conditions. Conditions including diabetes, thyroid problems, migraines, anemia, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have all been associated with tinnitus.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will typically diagnose you with tinnitus based on your symptoms alone. But in order to treat your symptoms, your doctor will also try to identify whether your tinnitus is caused by another, underlying condition. Sometimes a cause can't be found.\nTo help identify the cause of your tinnitus, your doctor will likely ask you about your medical history and examine your ears, head and neck. Common tests include:\n\n    Hearing (audiological) exam. During the test, you'll sit in a soundproof room wearing earphones that transmit specific sounds into one ear at a time. You'll indicate when you can hear the sound, and your results will be compared with results considered normal for your age. This can help rule out or identify possible causes of tinnitus.\n    Movement. Your doctor may ask you to move your eyes, clench your jaw, or move your neck, arms and legs. If your tinnitus changes or worsens, it may help identify an underlying disorder that needs treatment.\n    Imaging tests. Depending on the suspected cause of your tinnitus, you may need imaging tests such as CT or MRI scans.\n    Lab tests. Your doctor may draw blood to check for anemia, thyroid problems, heart disease or vitamin deficiencies.\n\nDo your best to describe for your doctor what kind of tinnitus noises you hear. The sounds you hear can help your doctor identify a possible underlying cause.\n\n    Clicking. This type of sound suggests that muscle contractions in and around your ear might be the cause of your tinnitus.\n    Pulsing, rushing or humming. These sounds usually stem from blood vessel (vascular) causes, such as high blood pressure, and you may notice them when you exercise or change positions, such as when you lie down or stand up.\n    Low-pitched ringing. This type of sound may point to ear canal blockages, Meniere's disease or stiff inner ear bones (otosclerosis).\n    High-pitched ringing. This is the most commonly heard tinnitus sound. Likely causes include loud noise exposure, hearing loss or medications. Acoustic neuroma can cause continuous, high-pitched ringing in one ear.\nMore InformationCT scanMRI\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for tinnitus depends on whether your tinnitus is caused by an underlying health condition. If so, your doctor may be able to reduce your symptoms by treating the underlying cause. Examples include:\n\n    Earwax removal. Removing an earwax blockage can decrease tinnitus symptoms.\n    Treating a blood vessel condition. Underlying blood vessel conditions may require medication, surgery or another treatment to address the problem.\n    Hearing aids. If your tinnitus is caused by noise-induced or age-related hearing loss, using hearing aids may help improve your symptoms.\n    Changing your medication. If a medication you're taking appears to be the cause of tinnitus, your doctor may recommend stopping or reducing the drug, or switching to a different medication.\n\n        \n            \n            Noise suppressionMany times, tinnitus can't be cured. But there are treatments that can help make your symptoms less noticeable. Your doctor may suggest using an electronic device to suppress the noise. Devices include:\n\n    White noise machines. These devices, which produce a sound similar to static, or environmental sounds such as falling rain or ocean waves, are often an effective treatment for tinnitus. You may want to try a white noise machine with pillow speakers to help you sleep. Fans, humidifiers, dehumidifiers and air conditioners in the bedroom also produce white noise and may help make tinnitus less noticeable at night.\n    Masking devices. Worn in the ear and similar to hearing aids, these devices produce a continuous, low-level white noise that suppresses tinnitus symptoms.\n\n        \n            \n            CounselingBehavioral treatment options aim to help you live with tinnitus by helping you change the way you think and feel about your symptoms. Over time, your tinnitus may bother you less. Counseling options include:\n\n    Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). TRT is an individualized program that is usually administered by an audiologist or at a tinnitus treatment center. TRT combines sound masking and counseling from a trained professional. Typically, you wear a device in your ear that helps mask your tinnitus symptoms while you also receive directive counseling. Over time, TRT may help you notice tinnitus less and feel less distressed by your symptoms.\n    Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or other forms of counseling. A licensed mental health professional or psychologist can help you learn coping techniques to make tinnitus symptoms less bothersome. Counseling can also help with other problems often linked to tinnitus, including anxiety and depression. Many mental health professionals offer CBT for tinnitus in individual or group sessions, and CBT programs are also available online.\n\n        \n            \n            MedicationsDrugs can't cure tinnitus, but in some cases they may help reduce the severity of symptoms or complications. To help relieve your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe medication to treat an underlying condition or to help treat the anxiety and depression that often accompany tinnitus.\n        \n            \n            Potential future treatmentsResearchers are investigating whether magnetic or electrical stimulation of the brain can help relieve symptoms of tinnitus.

The doctor inserts a thin needle through the skin and guides it into the tumor. The needle is used to remove small pieces of tissue from the tumor.\n    Surgical biopsy. The doctor makes an incision through the skin and removes either the entire tumor (excisional biopsy) or a portion of the tumor (incisional biopsy).\n\nDetermining the type of biopsy needed and the specifics of how it should be performed requires careful planning by the medical team. Doctors need to perform the biopsy in a way that won't interfere with future surgery to remove the cancer.

Instead, screening for Reye's syndrome usually begins with blood and urine tests as well as testing for fatty acid oxidation disorders and other metabolic disorders.\nSometimes more-invasive diagnostic tests are needed to evaluate other possible causes of liver problems and investigate any neurological abnormalities. For example:\n\n    \n    Spinal tap (lumbar puncture). A spinal tap can help the doctor identify or rule out other diseases with similar signs and symptoms, such as infection of the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or inflammation or infection of the brain (encephalitis).\n    During a spinal tap, a needle is inserted through the lower back into a space below the end of the spinal cord.

{"Diseases": "Rett syndrome", "Symptoms": "Babies with Rett syndrome typically are born after a normal pregnancy and delivery. Most infants with Rett syndrome seem to grow and behave normally for the first six months. After that, signs and symptoms start to appear.\nThe most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age, over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms and their severity can vary greatly from child to child.\nRett syndrome signs and symptoms include:\n\n    Slowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than normal head size (microcephaly) is usually the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older, delayed growth in other parts of the body becomes evident.\n    Loss of normal movement and coordination. The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk normally. At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or may become rigid or spastic with abnormal movement and positioning.\n    Loss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of speech. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills.\n    Abnormal hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome typically develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements that may differ for each person. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing.\n    Unusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time.\n    Breathing problems. These include breath-holding, abnormally rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forceful exhalation of air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours, but breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or periodic breathing can occur during sleep.\n    Irritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. Some children may experience fears and anxiety.\n    Other abnormal behaviors. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing.\n    Cognitive disabilities. Loss of skills can be accompanied by a loss of intellectual functioning.\n    Seizures. Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives. Multiple seizure types may occur and are accompanied by an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG).\n    Abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and increases with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe.\n    Irregular heartbeat. This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death.\n    Sleep disturbances. Abnormal sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming.\n     Other symptoms. A variety of other symptoms can occur, such as thin, fragile bones prone to factures; small hands and feet that are usually cold; problems with chewing and swallowing; problems with bowel function; and teeth grinding.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Stages of Rett syndromeRett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages:\n\n    Stage I: early onset. Signs and symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked during the first stage, which starts between 6 and 18 months of age and can last for a few months or a year. Babies in this stage may show less eye contact and start to lose interest in toys. They may also have delays in sitting or crawling.\n    Stage II: rapid deterioration. Starting between 1 and 4 years of age, children lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over weeks or months. Symptoms of Rett syndrome occur, such as slowed head growth, abnormal hand movements, hyperventilating, screaming or crying for no apparent reason, problems with movement and coordination, and a loss of social interaction and communication.\n    Stage III: plateau. The third stage usually begins between the ages of 2 and 10 years and can last for many years. Although problems with movement continue, behavior may have limited improvement, with less crying and irritability, and some improvement in hand use and communication. Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don't occur before the age of 2.\n    Stage IV: late motor deterioration.

The test requires drawing a small amount of blood from a vein in the arm. The blood is then sent to a lab, where technicians examine your child's DNA for abnormalities and clues as to the cause and severity of the disorder.

Physical therapy and the use of braces or casts can help children who have scoliosis or require hand or joint support. In some cases, physical therapy can also help maintain movement, create a proper sitting position, and improve walking skills, balance and flexibility. Assistive devices may be helpful.\n    Occupational therapy. Occupational therapy may improve purposeful use of the hands for activities such as dressing and feeding. If repetitive arm and hand movements are a problem, splints that restrict elbow or wrist motion may be helpful.\n    Speech-language therapy. Speech-language therapy can help improve a child's life by teaching nonverbal ways of communicating and helping with social interaction.\n    Nutritional support. Proper nutrition is extremely important for normal growth and for improved mental, physical and social abilities. A high-calorie, well-balanced diet may be recommended.

Fats, cholesterol and other substances (plaque) can build up in and on your kidney artery walls (atherosclerosis). As these deposits get larger, they can harden, reduce blood flow, cause kidney scarring and eventually narrow the artery. Atherosclerosis occurs in many areas of the body and is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis.\n    \n    Fibromuscular dysplasia. In fibromuscular dysplasia, the muscle in the artery wall grows abnormally, often from childhood. The renal artery can have narrow sections alternating with wider sections, giving a bead-like appearance in images of the artery.\n    The renal artery can narrow so much that the kidney doesn't get an adequate supply of blood and can lead to high blood pressure at a young age. This can happen in one or both kidneys. Experts don't know what causes fibromuscular dysplasia, but the condition is more common in women and may be something that's present at birth (congenital).\n    \n\nNarrowed kidney arteries and fibromuscular dysplasia can affect other arteries in your body as well as your kidney arteries and cause complications.\nRarely, renal artery stenosis results from other conditions such as inflammation of the blood vessels or a growth that develops in your abdomen and presses on your kidneys' arteries.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "For diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, your doctor may start with:\n\n    A physical exam that includes your doctor listening through a stethoscope over the kidney areas for sounds that may mean the artery to your kidney is narrowed\n    A review of your medical history\n    Blood and urine tests to check your kidney function\n    Blood and urine tests to measure the levels of hormones that regulate blood pressure\n\nImaging tests commonly done to diagnose renal artery stenosis include:\n\n    Doppler ultrasound. High-frequency sound waves help your doctor see the arteries and kidneys and check their function. This procedure also helps your doctor find blockages in the blood vessels and measure their severity.\n    CT scan. During a CT scan, an X-ray machine linked to a computer creates a detailed image that shows cross-sectional images of the renal arteries. You may receive a dye injection to show blood flow.\n    Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). MRA uses radio waves and strong magnetic fields to produce detailed 3D images of the renal arteries and kidneys. A dye injection into the arteries outlines blood vessels during imaging.\n    Renal arteriography. This special type of X-ray exam helps your doctor find the blockage in the renal arteries and sometimes open the narrowed part with a balloon and/or stent. Before an X-ray is taken, your doctor injects a dye into the renal arteries through a long, thin tube (catheter) to outline the arteries and show blood flow more clearly.

Procedures to open the vessel should be considered for people who don't do well on medicine alone, who can't tolerate medications, who often retain fluids and who have treatment-resistant heart failure.\nProcedures to treat renal artery stenosis may include:\n\n    Renal angioplasty and stenting. In this procedure, doctors widen the narrowed renal artery and place a device (stent) inside your blood vessel that holds the walls of the vessel open and allows for better blood flow.\n    Renal artery bypass surgery. During a bypass procedure, doctors graft a substitute blood vessel to the renal artery to make a new route for blood to reach your kidneys. Sometimes this means connecting the renal artery to a vessel from somewhere else, such as the liver or spleen.

Children with primary vesicoureteral reflux are born with a defect in the valve that normally prevents urine from flowing backward from the bladder into the ureters. Primary vesicoureteral reflux is the more common type.\n    As your child grows, the ureters lengthen and straighten, which may improve valve function and eventually correct the reflux. This type of vesicoureteral reflux tends to run in families, which indicates that it may be genetic, but the exact cause of the defect is unknown.\n    \n    Secondary vesicoureteral reflux. The cause of this form of reflux is most often from failure of the bladder to empty properly, either due to a blockage or failure of the bladder muscle or damage to the nerves that control normal bladder emptying.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "A urine test can reveal whether your child has a UTI.

This same technology, often used during pregnancy to monitor fetal development, may also reveal swollen kidneys in the baby, an indication of primary vesicoureteral reflux.\n    \n    Specialized X-ray of urinary tract system. This test uses X-rays of the bladder when it's full and when it's emptying to detect abnormalities. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted through the urethra and into the bladder while your child lies on his or her back on an X-ray table. After contrast dye is injected into the bladder through the catheter, your child's bladder is X-rayed in various positions.\n    Then the catheter is removed so that your child can urinate, and more X-rays are taken of the bladder and urethra during urination to see whether the urinary tract is functioning correctly. Risks associated with this test include discomfort from the catheter or from having a full bladder and the possibility of a new urinary tract infection.\n    \n    Nuclear scan.

A defect in the valve keeps it from closing and preventing urine from flowing backward.\nMethods of surgical repair include:\n\n    Open surgery. Performed using general anesthesia, this surgery requires an incision in the lower abdomen through which the surgeon repairs the problem. This type of surgery usually requires a few days' stay in the hospital, during which a catheter is kept in place to drain your child's bladder. Vesicoureteral reflux may persist in a small number of children, but it generally resolves on its own without need for further intervention.\n    \n    Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Similar to open surgery, this procedure involves repairing the valve between the ureter and the bladder, but it's performed using small incisions. Advantages include smaller incisions and possibly less bladder spasms than open surgery.\n    But, preliminary findings suggest that robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery may not have as high of a success rate as open surgery. The procedure was also associated with a longer operating time, but a shorter hospital stay.\n    \n    \n    Endoscopic surgery. In this procedure, the doctor inserts a lighted tube (cystoscope) through the urethra to see inside your child's bladder, and then injects a bulking agent around the opening of the affected ureter to try to strengthen the valve's ability to close properly.\n    This method is minimally invasive compared with open surgery and presents fewer risks, though it may not be as effective. This procedure also requires general anesthesia, but generally can be performed as outpatient surgery.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Treatment of vesicoureteral reflux at Mayo Clinic is unique in its individualized approach to medical care.

Later, these cells begin growing again.\nThe chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy or other treatment you may have received after your first breast cancer diagnosis was intended to kill any cancer cells that may have remained after surgery. But sometimes these treatments aren't able to kill all of the cancer cells.\nSometimes cancer cells may be dormant for years without causing harm. Then something happens that activates the cells, so they grow and spread to other parts of the body. It's not clear why this occurs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "If your doctor suspects you may have recurrent breast cancer based on results of a mammogram or physical exam, or because of signs and symptoms, he or she may recommend additional tests to confirm the diagnosis.\nTests and procedures may include:\n\n    \n    Imaging tests. What imaging tests you'll undergo will depend on your specific situation. Imaging tests may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), X-ray, bone scan or positron emission tomography (PET).\n    Not every person needs every test. Your doctor will determine which tests are most helpful in your particular situation.\n    \n    \n    Removing a sample of tissue for lab testing (biopsy). Your doctor may recommend a biopsy procedure to collect suspicious cells for testing, as this is the only way to confirm whether your cancer has returned. Working in a laboratory, a pathologist examines the cells and determines the types of cells involved.\n    A pathologist can determine if the cancer is a recurrence of cancer or a new type of cancer. Tests also show whether the cancer is sensitive to hormone treatment or targeted therapy, since these may have changed since your original cancer diagnosis.\n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your recurrent breast cancer-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationRecurrent breast cancer care at Mayo ClinicBone scanBreast biopsyBreast MRIChest X-raysCT scanMammogramMRIPositron emission tomography scanUltrasoundX-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Your treatment options will depend on several factors, including the extent of the disease, its hormone receptor status, the type of treatment you received for your first breast cancer and your overall health. Your doctor also considers your goals and your preferences for treatment.\n        \n            \n            Treating a local recurrenceTreatment for a local recurrence typically starts with an operation and may include radiation if you haven't had it before. Chemotherapy and hormone therapy also may be recommended.\n\n    \n    Surgery. For recurrent breast cancer that's confined to the breast, treatment usually involves removing any remaining breast tissue.\n    If your first cancer was treated with a lumpectomy, your doctor may recommend a mastectomy to remove all of your breast tissue \u2014 lobules, ducts, fatty tissue, skin and nipple.\n    If your first breast cancer was treated with a mastectomy and the cancer comes back in the chest wall, you may have surgery to remove the new cancer along with a margin of normal tissue.\n    A local recurrence may be accompanied by hidden cancer in nearby lymph nodes. For this reason, the surgeon may remove some or all of the nearby lymph nodes if they weren't removed during your initial treatment.\n    \n    Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If you didn't have radiation therapy for your first breast cancer, your doctor may recommend it now. But if you had radiation after a lumpectomy, radiation to treat the recurrence isn't usually recommended because of the risk of side effects.\n    Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy after surgery to reduce your risk of another cancer recurrence.\n    Hormone therapy. Medications that block the growth-promoting effects of the hormones estrogen and progesterone may be recommended if your cancer is hormone receptor positive.\n    Targeted therapy. If testing shows your cancer cells produce excess HER2 protein, medications that target that protein will likely be recommended.\n\n        \n            \n            Treating a regional recurrenceTreatments for a regional breast cancer recurrence include:\n\n    Surgery. If it's possible, surgery to remove the cancer is the recommended treatment for a regional recurrence. Your surgeon may also remove the lymph nodes under your arm if they're still present.\n    Radiation therapy. Sometimes radiation therapy may be used after surgery. If surgery isn't possible, radiation therapy may be used as the main treatment for a regional breast cancer recurrence.\n    Drug treatments. Chemotherapy, targeted therapy or hormone therapy also may be recommended as the main treatment or may follow surgery or radiation.\n\n        \n            \n            Treating a metastatic recurrenceMany treatments exist for metastatic breast cancer. Your options will depend on where your cancer has spread. If one treatment doesn't work or stops working, you may be able to try other treatments.\nIn general, the goal of treatment for metastatic breast cancer isn't to cure the disease. Treatment may allow you to live longer and can help relieve symptoms the cancer is causing. Your doctor works to achieve a balance between controlling your symptoms while minimizing toxic effects from treatment. The aim is to help you live as well as possible for as long as possible.\nTreatments may include:\n\n    Hormone therapy. If your cancer is hormone receptor positive, you may benefit from hormone therapy. In general, hormone therapy has fewer side effects than chemotherapy, so in many cases it's the first treatment used for metastatic breast cancer.\n    Chemotherapy. Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy if your cancer is hormone receptor negative or if hormone therapy is no longer working.\n    Targeted therapy. If your cancer cells have certain characteristics that make them vulnerable to targeted therapy, your doctor may recommend these medications.\n    \n    Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.\n    Immunotherapy might be an option if you have triple-negative breast cancer, which means that the cancer cells don't have receptors for estrogen, progesterone or HER2. For triple-negative breast cancer, immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy to treat advanced cancer that's spread to other parts of the body.\n    \n    Bone-building drugs.

{"Diseases": "Rectovaginal fistula", "Symptoms": "Depending on the fistula's size and location, you may have minor symptoms or significant problems with continence and hygiene. Signs and symptoms of a rectovaginal fistula may include:\n\n    Passage of gas, stool or pus from your vagina\n    Foul-smelling vaginal discharge\n    Recurrent vaginal or urinary tract infections\n    Irritation or pain in the vulva, vagina and the area between your vagina and anus (perineum)\n    Pain during sexual intercourse\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms of a rectovaginal fistula. A fistula may be the first warning of a more serious problem, such as an infected, pus-filled area (abscess) or cancer. Identifying the cause of the fistula can help your doctor determine a treatment plan.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "A rectovaginal fistula may form as a result of:\n\n    Injuries during childbirth. Delivery-related injuries are the most common cause of rectovaginal fistulas. This includes tears in the perineum that extend to the bowel, or an infection of an episiotomy \u2014 a surgical incision to enlarge the perineum during vaginal delivery. These may happen following a long, difficult, or obstructed labor. These types of fistulas may also involve injury to your anal sphincter, the rings of muscle at the end of the rectum that help you hold in stool.\n    Crohn's disease. The second most common cause of rectovaginal fistulas, Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease in which the digestive tract lining is inflamed. Most women with Crohn's disease never develop a rectovaginal fistula, but having Crohn's disease does increase your risk of the condition.\n    Cancer or radiation treatment in your pelvic area. A cancerous tumor in your rectum, cervix, vagina, uterus or anal canal can result in a rectovaginal fistula. Radiation therapy for cancers in these areas can also put you at risk. A fistula caused by radiation usually forms within six months to two years after treatment.\n    Surgery involving your vagina, perineum, rectum or anus. Prior surgery in your lower pelvic region, such as removal of your uterus (hysterectomy), in rare cases can lead to development of a fistula. The fistula may develop as a result of an injury during surgery or a leak or infection that develops afterward.\n    Other causes. Rarely, a rectovaginal fistula may be caused by infections in your anus or rectum; infections of small, bulging pouches in your digestive tract (diverticulitis); long-term inflammation of your colon and rectum (ulcerative colitis); dry, hard stool that gets stuck in the rectum (fecal impaction); or vaginal injury unrelated to childbirth.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "You can expect a physical exam and certain tests, depending on your needs.\nPhysical exam\nYour doctor will perform a physical exam to try to locate the rectovaginal fistula and check for a possible tumor mass, infection or abscess. The doctor's exam includes inspecting your vagina, anus and the area between them (perineum) with a gloved hand.\nUnless the fistula is very low in the vagina and readily visible, your doctor may use a speculum to see inside your vagina. An instrument similar to a speculum, called a proctoscope, may be inserted into your anus and rectum to check for problems.\nYour doctor may take a sample of tissue for lab analysis (biopsy) during the procedure.\nTests for identifying fistulas\nYour doctor may not find a fistula during the physical exam. Other tests may be needed to locate and evaluate a rectovaginal fistula. These tests can also help your medical team in planning for surgery.\n\n    Contrast tests. A vaginogram or a barium enema can help identify a fistula located in the upper rectum. These tests use a contrast material to show the vagina or the bowel on an X-ray image.\n    Blue dye test. This test involves placing a tampon into your vagina, then injecting blue dye into your rectum. Blue staining on the tampon indicates a fistula.\n    Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis provides more detail than does a standard X-ray. The CT scan can help locate a fistula and determine its cause.\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test creates images of soft tissues in your body. MRI can show the location of a fistula, whether other pelvic organs are involved or whether you have a tumor.\n    Anorectal ultrasound. This procedure uses sound waves to produce a video image of your anus and rectum. Your doctor inserts a narrow, wand-like instrument into your anus and rectum. This test can evaluate the structure of your anal sphincter and may show childbirth-related injury.\n    Anorectal manometry. This test measures the sensitivity and function of your rectum and can give information about the rectal sphincter and your ability to control stool passage. This test does not locate fistulas, but may help in planning the fistula repair.\n    Other tests. If your doctor suspects you have inflammatory bowel disease, he or she may order a colonoscopy to view your colon. During the procedure, your doctor can take small samples of tissue (biopsy) for lab analysis, which can help confirm Crohn's disease.\nMore InformationBarium enemaColonoscopyComputerized tomography (CT) urogramCT scanMRINeedle biopsyShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Symptoms of a rectovaginal fistula can be distressing, but treatment is often effective. Treatment for the fistula depends on its cause, size, location and effect on surrounding tissues.\nMedications\nYour doctor may recommend a medication to help treat the fistula or prepare you for surgery:\n\n    Antibiotics. If the area around your fistula is infected, you may be given a course of antibiotics before surgery. Antibiotics may also be recommended for women with Crohn's disease who develop a fistula.\n    Infliximab. Infliximab (Remicade) can help reduce inflammation and heal fistulas in women with Crohn's disease.\n\nSurgery\nMost people need surgery to close or repair a rectovaginal fistula.\nBefore an operation can be done, the skin and other tissue around the fistula must be healthy, without infection or inflammation. Your doctor may recommend waiting three to six months before having surgery to ensure the surrounding tissue is healthy and see if the fistula closes on its own.\nSurgery to close a fistula may be done by a gynecologic surgeon, a colorectal surgeon or both working as a team. The goal is to remove the fistula tract and close the opening by sewing together healthy tissue. Surgical options include:\n\n    Sewing an anal fistula plug or patch of biologic tissue into the fistula to allow your tissue to grow into the patch and heal the fistula.\n    Using a tissue graft taken from a nearby part of your body or folding a flap of healthy tissue over the fistula opening.\n    Repairing the anal sphincter muscles if they've been damaged by the fistula or by scarring or tissue damage from radiation or Crohn's disease.\n    Performing a colostomy before repairing a fistula in complex or recurrent cases to divert stool through an opening in your abdomen instead of through your rectum. Most of the time, this surgery isn't needed. But you may need this if you've had tissue damage or scarring from previous surgery or radiation treatment, an ongoing infection or significant fecal contamination, a cancerous tumor, or an abscess. If a colostomy is needed, your surgeon may wait eight to 12 weeks before repairing the fistula. Usually after about three to six months and confirmation that your fistula has healed, the colostomy can be reversed and normal bowel function restored.\n\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

During this test, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube with a tiny camera into your rectum to examine your rectum and part of your colon. If a lesion is found, your doctor may take a tissue sample for laboratory testing.\n    Ultrasound. This imaging technique uses sound waves to create pictures. Your doctor may recommend an ultrasound to help differentiate solitary rectal ulcer syndrome from other conditions.\n    \n    Other imaging studies. Your doctor may order an imaging study called defecation proctography. In this study, a soft paste made of barium is inserted into your rectum. You then pass the barium paste as you would stool. The barium shows up on X-rays and may reveal a prolapse or problems with muscle function and muscle coordination.\n    Specialized centers may offer a similar test called magnetic resonance defecography. This test is done with a magnetic resonance imaging machine and provides a 3D image of the rectum.\n    \nMore InformationFlexible sigmoidoscopyUltrasound\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for solitary rectal ulcer syndrome depends on the severity of your condition. People with mild signs and symptoms may find relief through lifestyle changes, while people with more severe signs and symptoms may require medical or surgical treatment.\n\n    Dietary changes. To relieve constipation, you may be given tips on increasing fiber in your diet.\n    \n    Behavior therapy. You may strain during bowel movements out of habit. Behavior therapy can help you learn to relax your pelvic muscles during bowel movements.\n    In one behavioral technique, called biofeedback, a specialist teaches you to control certain involuntary body responses, such as the tightening of your anus or pelvic floor muscles, during defecation. Biofeedback may make you more aware of your straining and help you to control it.\n    \n    Medications. Certain treatments such as topical steroids, sulfasalazine enemas and onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) may help ease your rectal ulcer symptoms. However, these treatments don't work for everyone, and some are still considered experimental.\n\nSurgical procedures used to treat solitary rectal ulcer syndrome include:\n\n    Rectal prolapse surgery. If you have a rectal prolapse that's causing symptoms, your doctor may recommend a rectopexy procedure. Rectopexy secures the rectum in its anatomically correct position.\n    Surgery to remove the rectum. An operation to remove the rectum may be an option if you have severe signs and symptoms that haven't been helped by other treatments. The surgeon may connect the colon to an opening in the abdomen for waste to leave the body (colostomy).

During the exam your doctor may ask you to bear down, to check for rectal prolapse.\n    Anal manometry. A narrow, flexible tube is inserted into the anus and rectum. A small balloon at the tip of the tube may be expanded. This test helps measure the tightness of your anal sphincter and the sensitivity and functioning of your rectum.\n    Colonoscopy. To rule out other conditions, such as polyps or colon cancer, you may have a colonoscopy, in which a flexible tube is inserted into your rectum to inspect the entire colon.\n    Defecography.

The affected body parts, usually fingers and toes, might turn white or blue and feel cold and numb until circulation improves, usually when you get warm.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSigns and symptoms of Raynaud's disease include:\n\n    Cold fingers or toes\n    Color changes in your skin in response to cold or stress\n    Numb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming or stress relief\n\nDuring an attack of Raynaud's, affected areas of your skin usually first turn white. Then, they often turn blue and feel cold and numb. As you warm and your circulation improves, the affected areas may turn red, throb, tingle or swell.\nAlthough Raynaud's most commonly affects your fingers and toes, it can also affect other areas of your body, such as your nose, lips, ears and even nipples. After you warm up, the return of normal blood flow to the area can take 15 minutes.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorSee your doctor right away if you have a history of severe Raynaud's and develop a sore or infection in one of your affected fingers or toes.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Doctors don't completely understand the cause of Raynaud's attacks, but blood vessels in the hands and feet appear to overreact to cold temperatures or stress.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Blood vessels in spasmWith Raynaud's, arteries to your fingers and toes become narrow and briefly limit blood supply when exposed to cold or stress. Over time, these small arteries can thicken slightly, further limiting blood flow.\nCold temperatures are most likely to trigger an attack. Exposure to cold, such as putting your hands in cold water, taking something from a freezer or being in cold air, is the most likely trigger. For some people, emotional stress can trigger an episode.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Primary vs. secondary Raynaud'sThere are two main types of the condition.\n\n    Primary Raynaud's. Also called Raynaud's disease, this most common form isn't the result of an associated medical condition. It can be so mild that many people with primary Raynaud's don't seek treatment. And it can resolve on its own.\n    \n    Secondary Raynaud's. Also called Raynaud's phenomenon, this form is caused by an underlying problem. Although secondary Raynaud's is less common than the primary form, it tends to be more serious.\n    Signs and symptoms of secondary Raynaud's usually appear around age 40, later than they do for primary Raynaud's.\n    \n\nCauses of secondary Raynaud's include:\n\n    Connective tissue diseases. Most people who have a rare disease that leads to hardening and scarring of the skin (scleroderma) have Raynaud's. Other diseases that increase the risk of Raynaud's include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome.\n    Diseases of the arteries. These include a buildup of plaques in blood vessels that feed the heart, a disorder in which the blood vessels of the hands and feet become inflamed, and a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries of the lungs.\n    Carpal tunnel syndrome. This condition involves pressure on a major nerve to your hand, producing numbness and pain in the hand that can make the hand more susceptible to cold temperatures.\n    Repetitive action or vibration. Typing, playing piano or doing similar movements for long periods and operating vibrating tools, such as jackhammers, can lead to overuse injuries.\n    Smoking. Smoking constricts blood vessels.\n    Injuries to the hands or feet. Examples include a wrist fracture, surgery or frostbite.\n    Certain medications. These include beta blockers for high blood pressure, migraine medications that contain ergotamine and sumatriptan, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications, certain chemotherapy agents, and drugs that cause blood vessels to narrow, such as some over-the-counter cold medications.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history and perform a physical examination. Your doctor might also order tests to rule out other medical problems that can cause similar signs and symptoms.\n        \n            \n            Sorting out primary vs. secondary Raynaud'sTo tell the difference between primary and secondary Raynaud's, your doctor might do a test called nailfold capillaroscopy. During the test, the doctor looks at the skin at the base of your fingernail under a microscope or magnifier to look for deformities or swelling of the tiny blood vessels.\nIf your doctor thinks that another condition, such as an autoimmune disorder or a connective tissue disease, may be causing Raynaud's, he or she will likely order blood tests, such as:\n\n    Antinuclear antibodies test. Testing positive for these antibodies might be a sign of a stimulated immune system, common in people who have connective tissue diseases or other autoimmune disorders.\n    Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Your heartbeat is normally controlled by a natural pacemaker called the sinus node, which is located in the right atrium. The sinus node produces electrical impulses that normally start each heartbeat.\nFrom the sinus node, electrical impulses travel across the atria, causing the atrial muscles to contract and pump blood into the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles).\nThe electrical impulses then arrive at a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node \u2014 usually the only pathway for signals to travel from the atria to the ventricles.\nThe AV node slows down the electrical signal before sending it to the ventricles. This slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood. When electrical impulses reach the muscles of the ventricles, they contract, causing them to pump blood either to the lungs or to the rest of the body.\nWhen anything disrupts this complex system, it can cause the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia) or with an irregular rhythm.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\t\n\n    \n    Tachycardia consultation at Mayo Clinic\n    A thorough physical exam, medical history and testing is required to diagnose tachycardia.\n\n\nTo diagnose your condition and determine the specific type of tachycardia, your doctor will evaluate your symptoms, perform a physical examination, and ask you about your health habits and medical history. \nSeveral heart tests also may be necessary to diagnose tachycardia.\n        \n            \n            Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Electrocardiogram\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tElectrocardiogram\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tElectrocardiogram\n\t\t\t\tAn electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) records the electrical signal from your heart to check for different heart conditions.

You also may be able to slow your heart rate using simple physical movements. However, medication or other medical treatments may be needed to slow down your heartbeat.\nWays to slow your heartbeat include:\n\n    Vagal maneuvers. Your doctor may ask you to perform an action, called a vagal maneuver, during an episode of a fast heartbeat. The maneuvers include coughing, bearing down as if you're having a bowel movement and putting an ice pack on your face. Vagal maneuvers affect the vagus nerve, which helps control your heartbeat.\n    Medications. If vagal maneuvers don't stop the fast heartbeat, you may need an injection of an anti-arrhythmic drug to restore a normal heart rate. An injection of this drug is given at a hospital. Anti-arrhythmic medicine is also available in pill form.\n    Cardioversion. In this procedure, a shock is delivered to your heart through paddles, an automated external defibrillator (AED) or patches on your chest.

This procedure is often used when an extra electrical pathway is responsible for an increased heart rate.\n    \n    In this procedure, a doctor inserts catheters into your groin, arm or neck and guides them through the blood vessels to your heart. Electrodes at the catheter tips can use extreme cold or radiofrequency energy to damage (ablate) the extra electrical pathway and prevent it from sending electrical signals.\n    Catheter ablation does not require surgery to access the heart, but it may also be performed in conjunction with other heart valve or artery repair surgeries.\n    \n    Medications. Anti-arrhythmic medications taken by mouth may prevent a fast heart rate when taken regularly.\n    Other heart medications, such as calcium channel blockers and beta blockers, may be prescribed instead or in combination with anti-arrhythmic drugs.\n    \n    Pacemaker. Some types of tachycardias may be treated with a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that's surgically implanted under your skin. When the device senses an abnormal heartbeat, it sends an electrical pulse that helps the heart resume a normal beat.\n    Implantable cardioverter. If you're at risk of having a life-threatening tachycardia episode, your doctor may recommend an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The pager-sized device is surgically implanted in your chest. The ICD continuously monitors your heartbeat, detects an increase in heart rate and delivers precisely calibrated electrical shocks, if needed, to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n    \n    Surgery. Open-heart surgery may be needed in some cases to destroy an extra electrical pathway causing tachycardia.\n    Tachycardia may also be treated with a maze procedure. During this procedure, a surgeon makes small incisions in heart tissue to create a pattern or maze of scar tissue. Because scar tissue doesn't conduct electricity, it interferes with stray electrical impulses that cause some types of tachycardia.\n    Surgery is usually used only when other treatment options don't work or when surgery is needed to treat another heart disorder.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            \t\n\n    \n    Tachycardia consultation at Mayo Clinic\n    An implantable device, such as a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may be used to treat some types of tachycardia.\n\n\nPreventing blood clotsSome people with tachycardia have an increased risk of developing a blood clot that could cause a stroke or heart attack.

Pyloric stenosis is rare in babies older than 3 months.\nSigns include:\n\n    Vomiting after feeding. The baby may vomit forcefully, ejecting breast milk or formula up to several feet away (projectile vomiting). Vomiting might be mild at first and gradually become more severe as the pylorus opening narrows. The vomit may sometimes contain blood.\n    Persistent hunger. Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting.\n    Stomach contractions. You may notice wavelike contractions (peristalsis) that ripple across your baby's upper abdomen soon after feeding but before vomiting. This is caused by stomach muscles trying to force food through the narrowed pylorus.\n    Dehydration. Your baby might cry without tears or become lethargic. You might find yourself changing fewer wet diapers or diapers that aren't as wet as you expect.\n    Changes in bowel movements. Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated.\n    Weight problems.

Pumping of the right ventricle against increased pressure causes the right ventricle to become thicker (hypertrophied).\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPulmonary valve stenosis usually occurs when the pulmonary valve doesn't grow properly during fetal development. Babies who have the condition may have other congenital heart abnormalities, as well.  It's not known what causes the valve to develop abnormally.\nNormal pulmonary valve anatomy\nThe pulmonary valve is made up of three thin pieces of tissue called cusps that are arranged in a circle. With each heartbeat, the valve opens in the direction of blood flow \u2014 into the pulmonary artery and continuing to the lungs \u2014 then closes to prevent blood from flowing backward into the heart's right ventricle.\nWhat happens in pulmonary valve stenosis\nOne or more of the cusps may be defective or too thick, or the cusps may not separate from each other properly. If this happens, the valve doesn't open correctly, restricting blood flow.\nOther contributing conditions\nSometimes other medical conditions or having an artificial valve can cause the condition.\n\n    Carcinoid syndrome.

If your doctor hears a heart murmur during a routine checkup and suspects pulmonary stenosis, he or she may then use a variety of tests to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n    \n    Echocardiogram. Sound waves bounce off your heart and produce moving images that can be viewed on a video screen. This test is useful for checking the structure of the pulmonary valve, the location and severity of the narrowing (stenosis), and right ventricle size and function.\n    Doctors may also perform a 3-D echocardiogram.\n    \n    \n    Electrocardiogram. During this procedure, patches with wires (electrodes) are placed on your chest, wrists and ankles. The electrodes measure electrical activity in your heart, which is recorded on paper. This test helps determine if the muscular wall of your right ventricle is thickened (right ventricular hypertrophy).\n    \n    \n    Other imaging tests. MRI and CT scans are sometimes used to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary valve stenosis.\n    \n    \n    Cardiac catheterization. During this procedure, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into an artery or vein in your groin and threads it up to your heart or blood vessels. Dye injected through the catheter makes your blood vessels visible on X-rays. Doctors also use cardiac catheterization to measure the blood pressure in the heart chambers and blood vessels.\n    Doctors generally use this test only if they suspect that you or your child will need a balloon valvuloplasty, a procedure that can be done at the same time as cardiac catheterization.\n    \nMore InformationCardiac catheterizationCT scanEchocardiogramElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)MRIShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Pulmonary valve stenosis is classified as mild, moderate or severe, depending on a measurement of the blood pressure difference between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery.

Using the small tube that was threaded through a vein in your leg to your heart for a cardiac catheterization, your doctor places an uninflated balloon through the opening of the narrowed pulmonary valve. He or she then inflates the balloon, widening the narrowed valve to increase blood flow, and then removes the balloon.\n    The most common side effect of a balloon valvuloplasty is blood leakage back through the pulmonary valve (valve regurgitation). As with most procedures, there is a risk of bleeding, infection or blood clots.\n    \n    \n    Open-heart surgery. When a balloon valvuloplasty isn't an option, you may require open-heart surgery.

The most commonly affected areas are the lower back, elbows, knees, legs, soles of the feet, scalp, face and palms.\nMost types of psoriasis go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a time or even going into remission.\nThere are several types of psoriasis, including:\n\n    Plaque psoriasis. The most common form, plaque psoriasis causes dry, raised, red skin patches (lesions) covered with silvery scales. The plaques might be itchy or tender, and there may be few or many. They usually appear on elbows, knees, lower back and scalp.\n    Nail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe cases may cause the nail to crumble.\n    Guttate psoriasis. This type primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling lesions on the trunk, arms or legs.\n    Inverse psoriasis. This mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. Inverse psoriasis causes smooth patches of red skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis.\n    Pustular psoriasis. This rare form of psoriasis causes clearly defined pus-filled lesions that occur in widespread patches (generalized pustular psoriasis) or in smaller areas on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet.\n    Erythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover your entire body with a red, peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely.\n    Psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis causes swollen, painful joints that are typical of arthritis. Sometimes the joint symptoms are the first or only symptom or sign of psoriasis. And at times only nail changes are seen. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint. It can cause stiffness and progressive joint damage that in the most serious cases may lead to permanent joint damage.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorIf you suspect that you may have psoriasis, see your doctor.

Options include creams and ointments (topical therapy), light therapy (phototherapy), and oral or injected medication.\nWhich treatments you use depends on how severe the psoriasis is and how responsive it has been to previous treatment. You might need to try different drugs or a combination of treatments before you find an approach that works for you. Usually, however, the disease returns.\n        \n            \n            Topical therapy\n    \n    Corticosteroids. These drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications for treating mild to moderate psoriasis. They are available as ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, sprays and shampoos. Mild corticosteroid ointments (hydrocortisone) are usually recommended for sensitive areas, such as your face or skin folds, and for treating widespread patches. Topical corticosteroids might be applied once a day during flares, and on alternate days or weekends only to maintain remission.\n    Your doctor may prescribe a stronger corticosteroid cream or ointment\u2014 triamcinolone (Acetonide, Trianex), clobetasol (Temovate) for smaller, less-sensitive or tougher-to-treat areas.\n    Long-term use or overuse of strong corticosteroids can thin the skin. Over time, topical corticosteroids may stop working.\n    \n    Vitamin D analogues. Synthetic forms of vitamin D, such as calcipotriene and calcitriol (Vectical) slow skin cell growth. This type of drug may be used alone or with topical corticosteroids. Calcitriol may cause less irritation in sensitive areas. Calcipotriene and calcitriol are usually more expensive than topical corticosteroids.\n    \n    Retinoids. Tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage) is available as a gel and cream and applied once or twice daily. The most common side effects are skin irritation and increased sensitivity to light.\n    Tazarotene isn't recommended when you're pregnant or breast-feeding or if you intend to become pregnant.\n    \n    \n    Calcineurin inhibitors. Calcineurin inhibitors \u2014 such as tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) \u2014 reduce inflammation and plaque buildup.

It may be used alone, or to enhance the ability of other medications to more easily penetrate the skin.\n    \n    Coal tar. Coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. It's available over-the-counter or by prescription in various forms, such as shampoo, cream and oil. These products can irritate the skin. They're also messy, stain clothing and bedding, and can have a strong odor.\n    Coal tar treatment isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n    \n    Goeckerman therapy. Some doctors combine coal tar treatment with light therapy, which is known as Goeckerman therapy. The two therapies together are more effective than either alone because coal tar makes skin more receptive to UVB light.\n    Anthralin. Anthralin (another tar product) is a cream used to slow skin cell growth. It can also remove scales and make skin smoother. It should not be used on the face or genitals. Anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches. It's usually applied for a short time and then washed off.\n\n        \n            \n            Light therapyLight therapy is a first-line treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis, either alone or in combination with medications. It involves exposing the skin to controlled amounts of natural or artificial light. Repeated treatments are necessary. Talk with your doctor about whether home phototherapy is an option for you.\n\n    Sunlight. Brief, daily exposures to sunlight (heliotherapy) might improve psoriasis. Before beginning a sunlight regimen, ask your doctor about the safest way to use natural light for psoriasis treatment.\n    UVB broadband. Controlled doses of UVB broadband light from an artificial light source can treat single patches, widespread psoriasis and psoriasis that doesn't improve with topical treatments. Short-term side effects might include redness, itching and dry skin. Moisturizing regularly can help ease your discomfort.\n    UVB narrowband. UVB narrowband light therapy might be more effective than UVB broadband treatment and in many places has replaced broadband therapy. It's usually administered two or three times a week until the skin improves and then less frequently for maintenance therapy. Narrowband UVB phototherapy may cause more-severe and longer lasting burns, however.\n    \n    Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). This treatment involves taking a light-sensitizing medication (psoralen) before exposure to UVA light. UVA light penetrates deeper into the skin than does UVB light, and psoralen makes the skin more responsive to UVA exposure.\n    This more aggressive treatment consistently improves skin and is often used for more-severe cases of psoriasis. Short-term side effects include nausea, headache, burning and itching. Long-term side effects include dry and wrinkled skin, freckles, increased sun sensitivity, and increased risk of skin cancer, including melanoma.\n    \n    Excimer laser. With this form of light therapy, a strong UVB light targets only the affected skin. Excimer laser therapy requires fewer sessions than does traditional phototherapy because more powerful UVB light is used. Side effects can include redness and blistering.\n\n        \n            \n            Oral or injected medicationsIf you have moderate to severe psoriasis or other treatments haven't worked, your doctor may prescribe oral or injected (systemic) drugs. Because of the potential for severe side effects, some of these medications are used for only brief periods and might be alternated with other treatments.\n\n    Steroids. If you have a few small, persistent psoriasis patches, your doctor might suggest an injection of triamcinolone right into the lesions.\n    Retinoids. Acitretin (Soriatane) and other retinoids are pills used to reduce the production of skin cells. Side effects might include dry skin and muscle soreness. These drugs are not recommended when you're pregnant or breast-feeding or if you intend to become pregnant.\n    \n    Methotrexate. Usually administered weekly as a single oral dose, methotrexate (Trexall) decreases the production of skin cells and suppresses inflammation. It's less effective than adalimumab (Humira) and infliximab (Remicade). It might cause upset stomach, loss of appetite and fatigue. People taking methotrexate long term need ongoing testing to monitor their blood counts and liver function.\n    Men and women should stop taking methotrexate at least three months before attempting to conceive. This drug is not recommended when you're breast-feeding.\n    \n    \n    Cyclosporine. Taken orally for severe psoriasis, cyclosporine (Neoral) suppresses the immune system. It's similar to methotrexate in effectiveness but cannot be used continuously for more than a year. Like other immunosuppressant drugs, cyclosporine increases your risk of infection and other health problems, including cancer. People taking cyclosporine need ongoing monitoring of their blood pressure and kidney function.\n    These drugs are not recommended when you're pregnant, breast-feeding or if you intend to become pregnant.\n    \n    \n    Biologics. These drugs, usually administered by injection, alter the immune system in a way that disrupts the disease cycle and improves symptoms and signs of disease within weeks. Several of these drugs are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in people who haven't responded to first-line therapies. The therapeutic options are rapidly expanding. Examples include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz). These types of drugs are expensive and may or may not be covered by health insurance plans.\n    Biologics must be used with caution because they carry the risk of suppressing your immune system in ways that increase your risk of serious infections. In particular, people taking these treatments must be screened for tuberculosis.\n    \n    Other medications. Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when other drugs can't be given. Apremilast (Otezla) is taken by mouth twice a day. It's especially effective at reducing itching. Talk with your doctor about possible side effects of these drugs.\n\n        \n            \n            Treatment considerationsAlthough doctors choose treatments based on the type and severity of psoriasis and the areas of skin affected, the traditional approach is to start with the mildest treatments \u2014 topical creams and ultraviolet light therapy (phototherapy) \u2014 in people with typical skin lesions (plaques) and then progress to stronger ones only if necessary. People with pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis or associated arthritis usually need systemic therapy from the beginning of treatment. The goal is to find the most effective way to slow cell turnover with the fewest possible side effects.\n        \n            \n            Alternative medicineA number of alternative therapies claim to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, including special diets, creams, dietary supplements and herbs. None have definitively been proved effective. But some alternative therapies are deemed generally safe and might reduce itching and scaling in people with mild to moderate psoriasis. Other alternative therapies are useful in avoiding triggers, such as stress.\n\n    Aloe extract cream. Taken from the leaves of the aloe vera plant, aloe extract cream may reduce redness, scaling, itching and inflammation. You might need to use the cream several times a day for a month or more to see any improvement in your skin.\n    Fish oil supplements. Oral fish oil therapy used in combination with UVB therapy might reduce the amount of affected skin. Applying fish oil to the affected skin and covering it with a dressing for six hours a day for four weeks might improve scaling.\n    Oregon grape. Also known as barberry, this product is applied to the skin and may reduce the severity of psoriasis.\n    Essential oils. Essential oils used for aromatherapy have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nIf you're considering dietary supplements or other alternative therapy to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, consult your doctor. He or she can help you weigh the pros and cons of specific alternative therapies.More InformationPsoriasis care at Mayo ClinicPsoriasis and clinical trialsPsoriasis treatment optionsPhotodynamic therapyPsoriasis: Get the most out of your treatmentShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Most people who need surgery have a procedure in which the tumor is removed through the nasal cavity. It's called transsphenoidal surgery. Complication rates are low because no other areas of the brain are touched during surgery, and this surgery leaves no visible scars.\n    Transcranial surgery. If your tumor is large or has spread to nearby brain tissue, you may need this procedure, also known as a craniotomy. The surgeon removes the tumor through the upper part of the skull.\n\nThe outcome of surgery depends on the size and location of the tumor and your prolactin levels before surgery, as well as the skill of the surgeon. The higher the prolactin level, the slimmer the chance that prolactin production will return to normal after surgery.\nSurgery corrects the prolactin level in most people with small pituitary tumors. However, many pituitary tumors come back within five years of surgery. For people with larger tumors that can only be partially removed, drug therapy often can return the prolactin level to a normal range after surgery.\n        \n            \n            RadiationFor people who don't respond to medication and aren't candidates for surgery, radiation therapy may be an option.More InformationRadiation therapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Even after surgery, you may need to use eyeglasses for close-up work.\nTalk with your doctor about the possible side effects, as this procedure is not reversible. You might want to try monovision contact lenses for a while before you commit to surgery.\nRefractive surgical procedures include:\n\n    Conductive keratoplasty. This procedure uses radiofrequency energy to apply heat to tiny spots around the cornea. The heat causes the edge of the cornea to shrink slightly, increasing its curve (steepness) and focusing ability. The results of conductive keratoplasty are variable and may not be long lasting.\n    \n    Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). With this procedure, your eye surgeon makes a thin, hinged flap deeper into your cornea. He or she then uses a laser to remove inner layers of your cornea to steepen its domed shape.\n    Recovery from LASIK surgery is usually more rapid and less painful than other corneal surgeries.\n    \n    Laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK). The surgeon creates an ultra-thin flap only in the cornea's outer protective cover (epithelium). He or she then uses a laser to reshape the cornea's outer layers, steepening its curve, and then replaces the epithelium.\n    Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). This procedure is similar to LASEK, except the surgeon completely removes the epithelium, then uses the laser to reshape the cornea. The epithelium is not replaced, but will grow back naturally, conforming to your cornea's new shape.\n\n        \n            \n            Lens implantsSome ophthalmologists use a procedure in which they remove the lens in each eye and replace it with a synthetic lens. This is called an intraocular lens.\nSeveral types of lens implants are available for correcting presbyopia. Some allow your eye to see things both near and at a distance. Some change position or shape within the eye (accommodative lens). But lens implants can cause a decrease in the quality of your near vision, and you may still need reading glasses.\nPossible side effects include glare and blurring. In addition, this surgery carries with it the same risks as those associated with cataract surgery, such as inflammation, infection, bleeding and glaucoma.\n        \n            \n            Corneal inlaysSome people have had success with a presbyopia treatment that involves inserting a small plastic ring with a central opening, into the cornea of one eye. The opening acts like a pinhole camera and allows in focused light so that you can see close objects.\nIf you don't like the results of your corneal inlay procedure, your eye surgeon can remove the rings, leaving you free to consider other treatment options.More InformationLASIK eye surgery\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

It often happens about midway through the menstrual cycle, although the exact timing may vary.\n\n\nIn preparation for ovulation, the lining of the uterus, or endometrium, thickens. The pituitary gland in the brain stimulates one of the ovaries to release an egg. The wall of the ovarian follicle ruptures at the surface of the ovary. The egg is released.\n\nFinger-like structures called fimbriae sweep the egg into the neighboring fallopian tube. The egg travels through the fallopian tube, propelled in part by contractions in the fallopian tube walls. Here in the fallopian tube, the egg may be fertilized by a sperm.\n\nIf the egg is fertilized, the egg and sperm unite to form a one-celled entity called a zygote. As the zygote travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, it begins dividing rapidly to form a cluster of cells called a blastocyst, which resembles a tiny raspberry. When the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it implants in the lining of the uterus and pregnancy begins.\n\n\nIf the egg isn't fertilized, it's simply reabsorbed by the body \u2014 perhaps before it even reaches the uterus. About two weeks later, the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina. This is known as menstruation.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Most women have few signs of primary ovarian insufficiency, but your doctor may suspect the condition if you have irregular periods or are having trouble conceiving.

Your doctor might recommend:\n\n    \n    Estrogen therapy. Estrogen therapy can help prevent osteoporosis as well as relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of estrogen deficiency. Your doctor typically prescribes estrogen with the hormone progesterone, especially if you still have your uterus. Adding progesterone protects the lining of your uterus (endometrium) from precancerous changes that may be caused by taking estrogen alone.\n    The combination of hormones may make your period come back, but it won't restore ovarian function.

If you have both premature ejaculation and trouble getting or maintaining an erection, your doctor might order blood tests to check your male hormone (testosterone) levels or other tests.\nIn some cases, your doctor might suggest that you go to a urologist or a mental health professional who specializes in sexual dysfunction.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Common treatment options for premature ejaculation include behavioral techniques, topical anesthetics, medications and counseling. Keep in mind that it might take time to find the treatment or combination of treatments that will work for you. Behavioral treatment plus drug therapy might be the most effective course.\n        \n            \n            Behavioral techniquesIn some cases, therapy for premature ejaculation might involve taking simple steps, such as masturbating an hour or two before intercourse so that you're able to delay ejaculation during sex. Your doctor also might recommend avoiding intercourse for a period of time and focusing on other types of sexual play so that pressure is removed from your sexual encounters.\n        \n            \n            Pelvic floor exercises\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Male pelvic floor muscles\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMale pelvic floor muscles\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMale pelvic floor muscles\n\t\t\t\tMen's pelvic floor muscles support the bladder and bowel and affect sexual function. Kegel exercises can help strengthen these muscles.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nWeak pelvic floor muscles might impair your ability to delay ejaculation. Pelvic floor exercises (Kegel exercises) can help strengthen these muscles.\nTo perform these exercises:\n\n    Find the right muscles. To identify your pelvic floor muscles, stop urination in midstream or tighten the muscles that keep you from passing gas. These maneuvers use your pelvic floor muscles. Once you've identified your pelvic floor muscles, you can do the exercises in any position, although you might find it easier to do them lying down at first.\n    Perfect your technique. Tighten your pelvic floor muscles, hold the contraction for three seconds, and then relax for three seconds. Try it a few times in a row. When your muscles get stronger, try doing Kegel exercises while sitting, standing or walking.\n    Maintain your focus. For best results, focus on tightening only your pelvic floor muscles. Be careful not to flex the muscles in your abdomen, thighs or buttocks. Avoid holding your breath. Instead, breathe freely during the exercises.\n    Repeat 3 times a day. Aim for at least three sets of 10 repetitions a day.\n\n        \n            \n            The pause-squeeze techniqueYour doctor might instruct you and your partner in the use of a method called the pause-squeeze technique. This method works as follows:\n\n    Begin sexual activity as usual, including stimulation of the penis, until you feel almost ready to ejaculate.\n    Have your partner squeeze the end of your penis, at the point where the head (glans) joins the shaft, and maintain the squeeze for several seconds, until the urge to ejaculate passes.\n    Have your partner repeat the squeeze process as necessary.\n\nBy repeating as many times as necessary, you can reach the point of entering your partner without ejaculating. After some practice sessions, the feeling of knowing how to delay ejaculation might become a habit that no longer requires the pause-squeeze technique.\nIf the pause-squeeze technique causes pain or discomfort, another technique is to stop sexual stimulation just prior to ejaculation, wait until the level of arousal has diminished and then start again. This approach is known as the stop-start technique.\n        \n            \n            CondomsCondoms might decrease penis sensitivity, which can help delay ejaculation. \"Climax control\" condoms are available over the counter. These condoms contain numbing agents such as benzocaine or lidocaine or are made of thicker latex to delay ejaculation. Examples include Trojan Extended, Durex Performax Intense and Lifestyles Everlast Intense.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsTopical anesthetics\nAnesthetic creams and sprays that contain a numbing agent, such as benzocaine, lidocaine or prilocaine, are sometimes used to treat premature ejaculation. These products are applied to the penis 10 to 15 minutes before sex to reduce sensation and help delay ejaculation.\nA lidocaine-prilocaine cream for premature ejaculation (EMLA) is available by prescription. Lidocaine sprays for premature ejaculation are available over-the-counter.\nAlthough topical anesthetic agents are effective and well-tolerated, they have potential side effects. For example, some men report temporary loss of sensitivity and decreased sexual pleasure. Sometimes, female partners also have reported these effects.\nOral medications\nMany medications might delay orgasm. Although none of these drugs are specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat premature ejaculation, some are used for this purpose, including antidepressants, analgesics and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. These medications might be prescribed for either on-demand or daily use, and might be prescribed alone or in combination with other treatments.\n\n    \n    Antidepressants. A side effect of certain antidepressants is delayed orgasm. For this reason, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil) or fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem), are used to help delay ejaculation.\n    Of those approved for use in the United States, paroxetine seems to be the most effective. These medications usually take five to 10 days to begin working. But it might take two to three weeks of treatment before you'll see the full effect.\n    If SSRIs don't improve the timing of your ejaculation, your doctor might prescribe the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (Anafranil). Unwanted side effects of antidepressants might include nausea, perspiration, drowsiness and decreased libido.\n    \n    \n    Analgesics. Tramadol (Ultram) is a medication commonly used to treat pain. It also has side effects that delay ejaculation. Unwanted side effects might include nausea, headache, sleepiness and dizziness.\n    It might be prescribed when SSRIs haven't been effective. Tramadol can't be used in combination with an SSRI.\n    \n    Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Some medications used to treat erectile dysfunction, such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) or vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), also might help premature ejaculation. Unwanted side effects might include headache, facial flushing and indigestion. These medications might be more effective when used in combination with an SSRI. \n\nPotential future treatment\nResearch suggests that several drugs that might be helpful in treating premature ejaculation, but further study is needed. These drugs include:\n\n    Dapoxetine. This is an SSRI that's often used as the first treatment for premature ejaculation in other countries. It's not currently available in the United States.\n    Modafinil (Provigil). This is a treatment for the sleeping disorder narcolepsy.\n    Silodosin (Rapaflo).This drug is normally a treatment for prostate gland enlargement (benign prostatic hyperplasia).\n\n        \n            \n            CounselingThis approach involves talking with a mental health provider about your relationships and experiences. Sessions can help you reduce performance anxiety and find better ways of coping with stress. Counseling is most likely to help when it's used in combination with drug therapy.\nWith premature ejaculation, you might feel you lose some of the closeness shared with a sexual partner. You might feel angry, ashamed and upset, and turn away from your partner.\nYour partner also might be upset with the change in sexual intimacy. Premature ejaculation can cause partners to feel less connected or hurt. Talking about the problem is an important step, and relationship counseling or sex therapy might be helpful.More InformationCognitive behavioral therapySex therapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

The rhythm of your heart is normally controlled by a mass of tissue in the right atrium (sinus node). The sinus node produces electrical impulses, or signals, that cause each heartbeat.\nThese electrical signals travel across the atria, causing muscle contractions that pump blood into the ventricles. The signals then arrive at a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node \u2014 usually the only pathway for signals to travel from the atria to the ventricles. The AV node slows the electrical signal before sending it to the ventricles.\nThis slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood. When the electrical signals reach the ventricles, muscle contractions pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Abnormal electrical system in WPWIn WPW syndrome, an extra electrical pathway connects the atria and ventricles, allowing electrical impulses to bypass the AV node. This detour activates the ventricles too early.\nThe extra pathway can also transmit electrical impulses from the ventricles back to the atria, disrupting the coordinated movement of the electrical signals through the heart, leading to changes in the heart rhythm.\nThe most common arrhythmia associated with WPW syndrome is called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

As a result, sugar builds up in the blood instead of doing its normal job of giving energy to the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.\nMost of the glucose in your body comes from the food you eat. When food is digested, sugar enters your bloodstream. Moving sugar from your bloodstream to your body's cells requires a hormone called insulin.\nInsulin comes from a gland located behind the stomach called the pancreas.

A primary sign during infancy is poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Babies may rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended instead of fixed, and they may feel floppy or like rag dolls when they're held.\n    Distinct facial features. Children may be born with almond-shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip.\n    Poor sucking reflex. Infants may have a poor sucking reflex due to decreased muscle tone. Poor sucking makes feeding difficult and can result in failure to thrive.\n    Generally poor responsiveness. A baby may seem unusually tired, respond poorly to stimulation, have a hard time waking up or have a weak cry.\n    Underdeveloped genitals. Males may have a small penis and scrotum. The testicles may be small or not descended from the abdomen into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). In females, the clitoris and labia may be small.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Early childhood to adulthoodOther features of Prader-Willi syndrome appear during early childhood and remain throughout life, requiring careful management. These features may include:\n\n    Food craving and weight gain. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a constant craving for food, resulting in rapid weight gain, starting around age 2 years. Constant hunger leads to eating often and consuming large portions. Unusual food-seeking behaviors, such as hoarding food, or eating frozen food or even garbage, may develop.\n    Underdeveloped sex organs. A condition called hypogonadism occurs when sex organs (testes in men and ovaries in women) produce little or no sex hormones. This results in underdeveloped sex organs, incomplete or delayed puberty, and in nearly all cases, infertility. Without treatment, women may not start menstruating until their 30s or may never menstruate, and men may not have much facial hair and their voices may never fully deepen.\n    Poor growth and physical development. Underproduction of growth hormone can result in short adult height, low muscle mass and high body fat. Other endocrine problems may include underproduction of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or central adrenal insufficiency, which prevents the body from responding appropriately during stress or infections.\n    Cognitive impairment. Mild to moderate intellectual disability, such as issues with thinking, reasoning and problem-solving, is a common feature of the disorder. Even those without significant intellectual disability have some learning disabilities.\n    Delayed motor development. Toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome often reach milestones in physical movement \u2014 for example, sitting up or walking \u2014 later than other children do.\n    Speech problems. Speech is often delayed. Poor articulation of words may be an ongoing problem into adulthood.\n    Behavioral problems. Children and adults may at times be stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative. They may throw temper tantrums, especially when denied food, and may not tolerate changes in routine. They may also develop obsessive-compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both. Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety and skin picking, may develop.\n    Sleep disorders.

Although the exact mechanisms responsible for Prader-Willi syndrome haven't been identified, the problem lies in the genes located in a particular region of chromosome 15.\nWith the exception of genes related to sex characteristics, all genes come in pairs \u2014 one copy inherited from your father (paternal gene) and one copy inherited from your mother (maternal gene). For most types of genes, if one copy is \"active,\" or expressed, then the other copy also is expressed, although it's normal for some types of genes to act alone.\nPrader-Willi syndrome occurs because certain paternal genes that should be expressed are not for one of these reasons:\n\n    Paternal genes on chromosome 15 are missing.\n    The child inherited two copies of chromosome 15 from the mother and no chromosome 15 from the father.\n    There's some error or defect in paternal genes on chromosome 15.\n\nIn Prader-Willi syndrome, a defect on chromosome 15 disrupts the normal functions of a portion of the brain called the hypothalamus, which controls the release of hormones. A hypothalamus that isn't functioning properly can interfere with processes that result in problems with hunger, growth, sexual development, body temperature, mood and sleep.\nIn most cases, Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by a random genetic error and is not inherited. Determining which genetic defect caused Prader-Willi syndrome can be helpful in genetic counseling.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Typically, doctors suspect Prader-Willi syndrome based on signs and symptoms.

A team of health professionals will likely work with you to manage the condition.\nYour team may include a doctor who treats hormonal disorders (endocrinologist), behavior specialists, a dietitian, physical and occupational therapists, a mental health professional, a geneticist, and other specialists as needed.\nAlthough specific treatments vary depending on symptoms, most children with Prader-Willi syndrome will need the following:\n\n    Good nutrition for infants. Many infants with Prader-Willi syndrome have difficulty feeding due to decreased muscle tone. Your child's pediatrician may recommend a high-calorie formula or special feeding methods to help your baby gain weight and will monitor your child's growth.\n    Human growth hormone (HGH) treatment. HGH treatment in children with Prader-Willi syndrome helps increase growth, improves muscle tone and decreases body fat. A doctor who treats hormonal disorders (endocrinologist) can help determine whether your child would benefit from HGH and discuss any risks. A sleep study is usually recommended before starting growth hormone treatment.\n    Sex hormone treatment. Your endocrinologist may suggest that your child take hormone replacement therapy (testosterone for males or estrogen and progesterone for females) to replenish low levels of sex hormones. Hormone replacement therapy usually starts when your child reaches the normal age for puberty and can help reduce the risk of developing thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). Surgery may be needed to correct undescended testicles.\n    Weight management. A dietitian can help you develop a healthy, reduced-calorie diet to help manage your child's weight while ensuring proper nutrition. A restricted-calorie diet may require supplemental vitamins or minerals to ensure balanced nutrition. Increasing physical activity and exercise can help manage weight and improve physical functioning.\n    Treatment of sleep disturbances. Treating sleep apnea and other sleep problems can improve daytime sleepiness and behavioral issues.\n    Various therapies. Your child will likely benefit from a range of therapies, including physical therapy to improve movement skills and strength, speech therapy to improve verbal skills, and occupational therapy to learn everyday skills. Developmental therapy to learn age-appropriate behaviors, social skills and interpersonal skills also may help. In the U.S., early intervention programs with these types of therapy are usually available for infants and toddlers through a state's health department. During school years, educational planning and support can maximize learning.\n    Behavior management. Setting strict limits on behavior, schedules and access to food and strict supervision of food intake may be required. Some people may need medication to manage behavior problems.\n    Mental health care. A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or a psychiatrist, may help address psychological problems \u2014 for example, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, skin picking or a mood disorder.\n    Other treatments.

But participants in the recent study differed from others in ways that potentially could impact the results. Individuals who are considering prazosin should speak with a doctor to determine whether or not their particular situation might merit a trial of this drug.\n\nYou and your doctor can work together to figure out the best medication, with the fewest side effects, for your symptoms and situation. You may see an improvement in your mood and other symptoms within a few weeks.\nTell your doctor about any side effects or problems with medications.

People who recover from the initial attack of polio often live for years without further signs or symptoms. The onset of late effects varies widely but typically begins at least 15 years after the initial diagnosis.\n    Gradual onset.

Electromyography measures the tiny electrical discharges produced in muscles. A thin-needle electrode is inserted into the muscles to be studied. An instrument records the electrical activity in your muscle at rest and as you contract the muscle.\n    In a variation of EMG called nerve conduction studies, two electrodes are taped to your skin above a nerve to be studied. A small shock is passed through the nerve to measure the speed of nerve signals. These tests help identify and exclude conditions such as an abnormal condition of your nerves (neuropathy) and a muscle tissue disorder (myopathy).\n    \n    Imaging. Your doctor might recommend an MRI or CT scan to see images of your brain and spinal cord. These tests can help exclude spinal disorders, such as the degenerative spine condition spondylosis or narrowing of your spinal column that puts pressure on your nerves (spinal stenosis).\n    Muscle biopsy. A muscle biopsy might be done to help your doctor look for evidence of another condition that could be causing the weakness.\n    Blood tests.

A lack of any of these hormones can cause problems throughout the body.\nHormones from the front of your pituitary gland include:\n\n    Growth hormone (GH). This hormone controls bone and tissue growth and maintains the right balance of muscle and fat tissue.\n    Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This hormone stimulates your thyroid gland to produce key hormones that regulate your metabolism. Shortage of TSH results in an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).\n    Luteinizing hormone (LH). In women, LH regulates estrogen.\n    Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Working with LH, FSH helps stimulate egg development and ovulation in women.\n    \n    Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

But in some cases it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become severe. \n\nHospital-acquired pneumonia\nSome people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness. Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may be more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already sick. People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in intensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia.\nHealth care-acquired pneumonia\nHealth care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people who live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient clinics, including kidney dialysis centers. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics.\nAspiration pneumonia\nAspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into your lungs. Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag reflex, such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Chest X-ray showing pneumonia\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tChest X-ray showing pneumonia\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tChest X-ray showing pneumonia\n\t\t\t\tThis chest X-ray shows an area of lung inflammation indicating the presence of pneumonia.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nYour doctor will start by asking about your medical history and doing a physical exam, including listening to your lungs with a stethoscope to check for abnormal bubbling or crackling sounds that suggest pneumonia.\nIf pneumonia is suspected, your doctor may recommend the following tests:\n\n    Blood tests. Blood tests are used to confirm an infection and to try to identify the type of organism causing the infection. However, precise identification isn't always possible.\n    Chest X-ray. This helps your doctor diagnose pneumonia and determine the extent and location of the infection. However, it can't tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia.\n    Pulse oximetry. This measures the oxygen level in your blood. Pneumonia can prevent your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.\n    Sputum test. A sample of fluid from your lungs (sputum) is taken after a deep cough and analyzed to help pinpoint the cause of the infection.\n\nYour doctor might order additional tests if you're older than age 65, are in the hospital, or have serious symptoms or health conditions. These may include:\n\n    CT scan. If your pneumonia isn't clearing as quickly as expected, your doctor may recommend a chest CT scan to obtain a more detailed image of your lungs.\n    Pleural fluid culture. A fluid sample is taken by putting a needle between your ribs from the pleural area and analyzed to help determine the type of infection.\nMore InformationChest X-rays\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for pneumonia involves curing the infection and preventing complications. People who have community-acquired pneumonia usually can be treated at home with medication. Although most symptoms ease in a few days or weeks, the feeling of tiredness can persist for a month or more.\nSpecific treatments depend on the type and severity of your pneumonia, your age and your overall health. The options include:\n\n    Antibiotics. These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It may take time to identify the type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms don't improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic.\n    Cough medicine. This medicine may be used to calm your cough so that you can rest. Because coughing helps loosen and move fluid from your lungs, it's a good idea not to eliminate your cough completely. In addition, you should know that very few studies have looked at whether over-the-counter cough medicines lessen coughing caused by pneumonia. If you want to try a cough suppressant, use the lowest dose that helps you rest.\n    Fever reducers/pain relievers. You may take these as needed for fever and discomfort.

Many experts consider it an autoimmune disease in which the body turns against its own cells. Researchers believe this autoimmune response may be triggered by environmental and genetic factors.\nThe liver inflammation seen in primary biliary cholangitis starts when certain types of white blood cells called T cells (T lymphocytes) start to collect in the liver. Normally, these immune cells detect and help defend against germs, such as bacteria and viruses. But in primary biliary cholangitis, they mistakenly destroy the healthy cells lining the small bile ducts in the liver.\nInflammation in the smallest ducts spreads and eventually damages other cells in the liver. As the cells die, they're replaced by scar tissue (fibrosis) that can lead to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is scarring of liver tissue that makes it difficult for your liver to work properly.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you about your health history and your family's health history, and perform a physical exam.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to diagnose primary biliary cholangitis.\nBlood tests:\n\n    Liver tests. These blood tests check the levels of enzymes that may signal liver disease and bile duct injury.\n    Antibody tests for signs of autoimmune disease. Blood tests may be done to check for anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs). These substances almost never occur in people without the disease, even if they have other liver disorders. Therefore, a positive AMA test is considered a very reliable sign of the disease. However, a small number of people with primary biliary cirrhosis don't have AMAs.\n    Cholesterol test. More than half the people with primary biliary cholangitis have extreme increases in blood fats (lipids), including total cholesterol level.\n\nImaging tests may not be needed. However, they may help your doctor confirm a diagnosis or rule out other conditions with similar signs and symptoms. Imaging tests looking at the liver and bile ducts may include:\n\n    Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of structures inside your body.\n    FibroScan. Using an ultrasound-like probe, this test can detect scarring of the liver.\n    Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). This special magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam creates detailed images of your organs and bile ducts.\n    Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). MRI is combined with sound waves to create a visual map (elastogram) of internal organs. The test is used to detect hardening of your liver (fibrosis) that might be a sign of cirrhosis.\n\nIf the diagnosis is still uncertain, your doctor may perform a liver biopsy. A small sample of liver tissue is removed through a small incision using a thin needle. It's examined in a laboratory, either to confirm the diagnosis or to determine the extent (stage) of the disease.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your primary biliary cholangitis-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationPrimary biliary cholangitis care at Mayo ClinicCT scanLiver biopsyMRIShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treating the diseaseThere's no cure for primary biliary cholangitis, but medications are available to help slow the progression of the disease and prevent complications. Options include:\n\n    Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). This medication, also known as ursodiol (Actigall, Urso), is commonly used first. It helps move bile through your liver. UDCA doesn't cure primary biliary cholangitis, but it seems to improve liver function and reduce liver scarring. It's less likely to help with itching and fatigue. Side effects may include weight gain, hair loss and diarrhea.\n    Obeticholic acid (Ocaliva). In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved this medication for primary biliary cholangitis. Studies show that when given alone or combined with ursodiol for 12 months it can help improve liver function and slow liver fibrosis. However, its use is often limited because it can cause increased itching.\n    Fibrates (Tricor). Researchers aren't exactly sure how this medicine works to help ease primary biliary cholangitis symptoms. But, when taken with UDCA, it has reduced liver inflammation and itching in some people. More studies are needed to determine long-term benefits.\n    Budesonide. When combined with UDCA, the corticosteroid budesonide may be of potential benefit for primary biliary cholangitis. However, this drug is associated with steroid-related side effects for people with more advanced disease. More long-term trials are necessary before budesonide can be recommended for treating this condition.\n    Liver transplant. When medications no longer control primary biliary cholangitis and the liver begins to fail, a liver transplant may help prolong life. A liver transplant replaces your diseased liver with a healthy one from a donor. Liver transplantation is associated with very good long-term outcomes for people with primary biliary cholangitis. However, sometimes the disease comes back several years later in the transplanted liver.\n\n        \n            \n            Treating the symptomsYour doctor may recommend treatments to control the signs and symptoms of primary biliary cholangitis and make you more comfortable.\nTreatment for fatigue\nPrimary biliary cholangitis causes fatigue. But your daily habits, proper diet and exercise, and other health conditions can affect how tired you feel. It is important to also be tested to exclude thyroid disease since it is more common in people with primary biliary cholangitis.\nTreatment for itching\n\n    Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine hydrochloride and loratadine are commonly used to reduce itching. They may help with sleep if itching keeps you awake.\n    Cholestyramine is a powder that must be mixed with food or liquids.\n    Rifampin is an antibiotic that may stop itching. Exactly how it does this is unknown. Researchers think it may block the brain's response to itch-inducing chemicals in the blood.\n    Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can help reduce the symptoms of itching.\n    Opioid antagonists such as those containing naloxone and naltrexone may help itching related to liver disease. Like rifampin, these drugs seem to reduce the itching sensation by acting on your brain.\n\nTreatment for dry eyes and mouth\nArtificial tears and saliva substitutes, available over-the-counter or by prescription, can help ease dry eyes and mouth. Chewing gum or sucking on hard candy also can help you make more saliva and relieve dry mouth.\n        \n            \n            Treating the complicationsCertain complications are commonly associated with primary biliary cholangitis. Your doctor may recommend:\n\n    Vitamin and mineral supplements. If your body isn't absorbing vitamins or other nutrients, you may need to take vitamins A, D, E and K, as well as calcium, folic acid or iron supplements.\n    Medication to lower cholesterol. If you have high cholesterol levels in your blood, your doctor may recommend taking a medication known as a statin.\n    Drugs to treat bone loss. If you have weak or thinning bones (osteoporosis), you may be prescribed medication or supplements, such as calcium and vitamin D, to reduce bone loss and improve bone density. Exercise such as walking and using light weights most days of the week can help increase your bone density.\n    Treatment for increased pressure in the portal vein (portal hypertension). Your doctor is likely to screen and monitor you for portal hypertension and enlarged veins if you have more advanced scarring (fibrosis or cirrhosis) from liver disease. Accumulating fluid in your abdomen (ascites) is a common side effect of portal hypertension. For mild fluid accumulation, your doctor may only recommend limiting salt in your diet.

They develop when the virus enters your body through tiny cuts, breaks or other weak spots on the bottoms of your feet.\nHPV is very common, and more than 100 kinds of the virus exist. But only a few of them cause warts on the feet. Other types of HPV are more likely to cause warts on other areas of your skin or on mucous membranes.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Transmission of the virusEach person's immune system responds differently to HPV. Not everyone who comes in contact with it develops warts. Even people in the same family react to the virus differently.\nThe HPV strains that cause plantar warts aren't highly contagious. So the virus isn't easily transmitted by direct contact from one person to another. But it thrives in warm, moist environments. Consequently, you may contract the virus by walking barefoot around swimming pools or locker rooms. If the virus spreads from the first site of infection, more warts may appear.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "In most cases, your doctor can diagnose a plantar wart with one or more of these techniques:\n\nExamining the lesion\nParing the lesion with a scalpel and checking for signs of dark, pinpoint dots \u2014 tiny clotted blood vessels\nRemoving a small section of the lesion (shave biopsy) and sending it to a laboratory for analysis\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Most plantar warts are harmless and go away without treatment, though it may take a year or two. If your warts are painful or spreading, you may want to try treating them with over-the-counter (nonprescription) medications or home remedies. You may need many repeated treatments before the warts go away, and they may return later.\n\nIf your self-care approaches haven't helped, talk with your doctor about these treatments:\n\nStronger peeling medicine (salicylic acid). Prescription-strength wart medications with salicylic acid work by removing layers of a wart a little bit at a time. They may also stimulate your immune system's ability to fight the wart.\n\nYour doctor will likely suggest you apply the medicine regularly at home, followed by occasional office visits.\nFreezing medicine (cryotherapy). Cryotherapy done at a doctor's office involves applying liquid nitrogen to the wart, either with a spray or a cotton swab. This method can be painful, so your doctor may numb the area first.\n\nThe chemical causes a blister to form around your wart, and the dead tissue sloughs off within a week or so. Cryotherapy may also stimulate your immune system to fight viral warts. You may need to return to the doctor's office for repeat treatments every two to four weeks until the wart disappears.\n\nSome studies suggest that cryotherapy combined with salicylic acid treatment is more effective than just cryotherapy, but further study is needed.\n        \n            \n            Surgical or other proceduresIf salicylic acid and freezing medicine don't work, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatments:\n\nOther acids. Your doctor shaves the surface of the wart and applies trichloroacetic acid with a wooden toothpick. You'll need to return to the doctor's office for repeat treatments every week or so. Side effects include burning and stinging. Between visits, you may be asked to apply salicylic acid to the wart.\nImmune therapy. This method uses medications or solutions to stimulate your immune system to fight viral warts. Your doctor may inject your warts with a foreign substance (antigen) or apply a solution or cream to the warts.\nMinor surgery. Your doctor cuts away the wart or destroys it by using an electric needle (electrodesiccation and curettage). This procedure can be painful, so your doctor will numb your skin first. Because surgery has a risk of scarring, this method usually isn't used to treat plantar warts unless other treatments have failed.\nLaser treatment. Pulsed-dye laser treatment burns closed (cauterizes) tiny blood vessels. The infected tissue eventually dies, and the wart falls off. This method requires repeat treatments every three to four weeks. The evidence for the effectiveness of this method is limited, and it can cause pain and potentially scarring.\nVaccine.

Often, people with PKD reach end-stage kidney disease between ages 55 to 65. But some people with PKD have a mild disease and might never progress to end-stage kidney disease.\nTreating polycystic kidney disease involves dealing with the following signs, symptoms and complications in their early stages:\n\n    \n    Kidney cyst growth. Tolvaptan therapy may be recommended for adults at risk of rapidly progressive ADPKD. Tolvaptan (Jynarque, Samsca) is a pill that you take by mouth that works to slow the rate of kidney cyst growth and the decline in how well your kidneys work.\n    There's a risk of serious liver injury when taking tolvaptan, and it can interact with other medicines you take. It's best to see a doctor who specializes in kidney health (nephrologist) when taking tolvaptan, so that you can be monitored for side effects and possible complications.\n    \n    \n    High blood pressure. Controlling high blood pressure can delay the progression of the disease and slow further kidney damage. Combining a low-sodium, low-fat diet that's moderate in protein and calorie content with not smoking, increasing exercise and reducing stress may help control high blood pressure.\n    However, medications are usually needed to control high blood pressure. Medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are often used to control high blood pressure.\n    \n    Declining kidney function. To help your kidneys stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible, experts recommend maintaining a normal body weight (body mass index). Drinking water and fluids throughout the day may help slow the growth of kidney cysts, which in turn could slow down a decline in kidney function. Following a low-salt diet and eating less protein might allow kidney cysts to respond better to the increase in fluids.\n    Pain. You might be able to control the pain of polycystic kidney disease with over-the-counter medications containing acetaminophen. For some people, however, the pain is more severe and constant. Your doctor might recommend a procedure using a needle to draw out cyst fluid and inject a medication (sclerosing agent) to shrink kidney cysts. Or you may need surgery to remove cysts if they're large enough to cause pressure and pain.\n    Bladder or kidney infections. Prompt treatment of infections with antibiotics is necessary to prevent kidney damage. Your doctor may investigate whether you have a simple bladder infection or a more complicated cyst or kidney infection. For more complicated infections, you may need to take a longer course of antibiotics.\n    Blood in the urine. You'll need to drink lots of fluids, preferably plain water, as soon as you notice blood in your urine to dilute the urine. Dilution might help prevent obstructive clots from forming in your urinary tract. In most cases, the bleeding will stop on its own. If it doesn't, it's important to contact your doctor.\n    Kidney failure. If your kidneys lose their ability to remove waste products and extra fluids from your blood, you'll eventually need either dialysis or a kidney transplant. Seeing your doctor regularly for monitoring of PKD allows for the best timing of a kidney transplant. You may be able to have a preemptive kidney transplant, which means you wouldn't need to start dialysis but would have the transplant instead.\n    \n    Aneurysms. If you have polycystic kidney disease and a family history of ruptured brain (intracranial) aneurysms, your doctor may recommend regular screening for intracranial aneurysms.\n    If an aneurysm is discovered, surgical clipping of the aneurysm to reduce the risk of bleeding may be an option, depending on its size. Nonsurgical treatment of small aneurysms may involve controlling high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, as well as quitting smoking.\n    \n\nEarly treatment offers the best chance of slowing polycystic kidney disease progression.

{"Diseases": "Pituitary tumors", "Symptoms": "Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Sometimes they are identified incidentally on an imaging test such as an MRI or CT performed for some other reason. Pituitary tumors that make hormones (functioning) can cause a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the hormone they produce. The signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors that don't make hormones (nonfunctioning) are related to their growth and the pressure they put on other structures.\nLarge pituitary tumors \u2014 those measuring about 1 centimeter (slightly less than a half-inch) or larger \u2014 are known as macroadenomas. Smaller tumors are called microadenomas.

Treatment for those that do depends on the type of tumor, its size and how far it has grown into your brain. Your age and overall health also are factors.\nTreatment involves a team of medical experts, possibly including a brain surgeon (neurosurgeon), endocrine system specialist (endocrinologist) and a radiation oncologist.

The success of surgery depends on the tumor type, its location, its size and whether the tumor has invaded surrounding tissues. The two main surgical techniques for treating pituitary tumors are:\n\n    Endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal approach. This usually enables your doctor to remove the tumor through your nose and sinuses without an external incision. No other part of your brain is affected, and there's no visible scar. Large tumors may be difficult to remove this way, especially if a tumor has invaded nearby nerves or brain tissue.\n    Transcranial approach (craniotomy). The tumor is removed through the upper part of your skull via an incision in your scalp. It's easier to reach large or more-complicated tumors using this procedure.\n\n        \n            \n            Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high-energy sources of radiation to destroy tumors. It can be used after surgery or alone if surgery isn't an option. Radiation therapy can be beneficial if a tumor persists or returns after surgery and causes signs and symptoms that medications don't relieve. Methods of radiation therapy include:\n\n    Stereotactic radiosurgery. Often delivered as a single high dose, this focuses radiation beams on the tumor without an incision. It delivers radiation beams the size and shape of the tumor into the tumor with the aid of special brain-imaging techniques. Minimal radiation comes in contact with healthy tissue surrounding the tumor, decreasing the risk of damage to normal tissue.\n    External beam radiation. This delivers radiation in small increments over time. A series of treatments, usually five times a week over a four- to six-week period, is performed on an outpatient basis. While this therapy is often effective, it may take years to fully control the tumor growth and hormone production. Radiation therapy may also damage remaining normal pituitary cells and normal brain tissue, particularly near the pituitary gland.\n    Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). This type of radiation therapy uses a computer that allows the doctor to shape the beams and surround the tumor from many different angles. The strength of the beams can also be limited, which means surrounding tissues will receive less radiation.\n    Proton beam therapy. Another radiation option, this type uses positively charged ions (protons) rather than X-rays. Unlike X-rays, proton beams stop after releasing their energy within their target. The beams can be finely controlled and can be used on tumors with less risk to healthy tissues. This type of therapy requires special equipment and isn't widely available.\n\nThe benefits and complications of these forms of radiation therapy often aren't immediate and may take months or years to be fully effective. A radiation oncologist will evaluate your condition and discuss the pros and cons of each option with you.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsTreatment with medications may help to block excess hormone secretion and sometimes shrink certain types of pituitary tumors:\n\n    Prolactin-secreting tumors (prolactinomas). The drugs cabergoline and bromocriptine (Parlodel, Cycloset) decrease prolactin secretion and often reduce tumor size. Possible side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, nasal stuffiness, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, confusion, and depression. Some people develop compulsive behaviors, such as gambling, while taking these medications.\n    \n    ACTH-producing tumors (Cushing syndrome). Medications to control excessive production of cortisol at the adrenal gland include ketoconazole, mitotane (Lysodren) and metyrapone (Metopirone). Osilodrostat (Isturisa) also decreases cortisol production. Potential adverse effects include a heart conduction abnormality that can lead to serious heartbeat irregularity. Mifepristone (Korlym, Mifeprex) is approved for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance. Mifepristone does not decrease cortisol production, but it blocks the effects of cortisol on your tissues. Side effects may include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headaches, muscle aches, high blood pressure, low potassium and swelling.\n    Pasireotide (Signifor) works by decreasing ACTH production from a pituitary tumor. This medication is given as an injection twice daily. It is recommended if pituitary surgery is unsuccessful or cannot be done. Side effects are fairly common, and may include diarrhea, nausea, high blood sugar, headache, abdominal pain and fatigue.\n    \n    \n    Growth hormone-secreting tumors. Two types of drugs are available for these types of pituitary tumors and are especially useful if surgery has been unsuccessful in normalizing growth hormone production. One type of drugs known as somatostatin analogs, which includes drugs such as octreotide (Sandostatin, Sandostatin LAR Depot) and lanreotide (Somatuline Depot), causes a decrease in growth hormone production and may shrink the tumor. These are given by injections, usually every four weeks. An oral preparation of octreotide (Mycapssa) is now available and has similar efficacy and side effects as the injectable preparation.\n    These drugs can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, dizziness, headache and pain at the site of injection. Many of these side effects improve or even go away with time. They can also cause gallstones and may worsen diabetes mellitus.\n    The second type of drugs, pegvisomant (Somavert), blocks the effect of excess growth hormone on the body. This drug, given by daily injections, may cause liver damage in some people.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Replacement of pituitary hormonesIf a pituitary tumor or surgery to remove it decreases hormone production, you'll likely need to take replacement hormones to maintain normal hormone levels. Some people who have radiation treatment also need pituitary hormone replacement.\n        \n            \n            Watchful waitingIn watchful waiting \u2014 also known as observation, expectant therapy or deferred therapy \u2014 you might need regular follow-up tests to determine if your tumor grows. This might be an option if your tumor isn't causing signs or symptoms.\nMany people with pituitary tumors function normally without treatment if the tumor isn't causing other problems. If you're younger, watchful waiting can be an option as long as you accept the possibility of your tumor changing or growing during the observation period, possibly requiring treatment. You and your doctor can weigh the risk of symptoms developing versus treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

Blood thinners can cause excessive bleeding. Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.\n    Clot-dissolving medications. Treatment with a clot-dissolving drug is called thrombolysis. The medication alteplase (Activase) is used to dissolve blood clots in people with extensive DVT, including those who have a blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism).\n    Compression stockings. Prescription-strength compression stockings help prevent swelling and reduce the chances of complications of DVT.\n    Vena cava filter. If you can't take blood thinners, a filter may be inserted into the main vein in your abdomen (vena cava) to prevent clots that break loose in leg veins from lodging in your lungs. Usually, the filter is removed when it's no longer needed.\n    Varicose vein stripping. Your doctor can surgically remove varicose veins that cause pain or recurrent thrombophlebitis.

Complications at birth may include:\n\n    Low birth weight\n    Delayed development\n    Facial abnormalities\n    Abnormally small head\n    Heart defects and other heart problems\n    Intellectual disability\n    Behavioral problems\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nSeek medical advice in these situations:\n\n    Newborns. If routine newborn screening tests show that your baby may have PKU, your child's doctor will want to start dietary treatment right away to prevent long-term problems.\n    Women of childbearing years. It's especially important for women with a history of PKU to see a doctor and maintain the PKU diet before becoming pregnant and during pregnancy to reduce the risk of high blood phenylalanine levels harming their unborn babies.\n    Adults. People with PKU continue to receive care across the life span. Adults with PKU who have stopped the PKU diet in their teens may benefit from a visit with their doctors. Returning to the diet may improve mental functioning and behavior and slow damage to the central nervous system that can result from high phenylalanine levels.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

These disorders are usually passed on by two carriers. Their health is rarely affected, but they have one mutated gene (recessive gene) and one normal gene (dominant gene) for the condition. Two carriers have a 25% chance of having an unaffected child with two normal genes (left), a 50% chance of having an unaffected child who also is a carrier (middle), and a 25% chance of having an affected child with two recessive genes (right).\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA defective gene (genetic mutation) causes PKU, which can be mild, moderate or severe. In a person with PKU, this defective gene causes a lack of or deficiency of the enzyme that's needed to process phenylalanine, an amino acid.\nA dangerous buildup of phenylalanine can develop when a person with PKU eats protein-rich foods, such as milk, cheese, nuts or meat, and even grains such as bread and pasta, or eats aspartame, an artificial sweetener. This buildup of phenylalanine results in damage to nerve cells in the brain.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            InheritanceFor a child to inherit PKU, both the mother and father must have and pass on the defective gene. This pattern of inheritance is called autosomal recessive.\nIt's possible for a parent to be a carrier \u2014 to have the defective gene that causes PKU, but not have the disease. If only one parent has the defective gene, there's no risk of passing PKU to a child, but it's possible for the child to be a carrier.\nMost often, PKU is passed to children by two parents who are carriers of the disorder, but don't know it.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Newborn blood testing identifies almost all cases of phenylketonuria. All 50 states in the United States require newborns to be screened for PKU. Many other countries also routinely screen infants for PKU.\nIf you have PKU or a family history of it, your doctor may recommend screening tests before pregnancy or birth. It's possible to identify PKU carriers through a blood test.\n        \n            \n            Testing your baby after birthA PKU test is done a day or two after your baby's birth. The test is done after your baby is 24 hours old and after your baby has ingested some protein in the diet to ensure accurate results.\n\n    A nurse or lab technician collects a few drops of blood from your baby's heel or the bend in your baby's arm.\n    A laboratory tests the blood sample for certain metabolic disorders, including PKU.\n    If you don't deliver your baby in a hospital or are discharged soon after the birth, you may need to schedule a newborn screening with your pediatrician or family doctor.\n\nIf this test indicates your baby may have PKU:\n\n    Your baby may have additional tests to confirm the diagnosis, including more blood tests and urine tests\n    You and your baby may have genetic testing to identify gene mutations\nMore InformationGenetic testing\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "The main treatment for PKU includes:\n\n    A lifetime diet with very limited intake of protein, because foods with protein contain phenylalanine\n\n\n    Taking a PKU formula \u2014 a special nutritional supplement \u2014 for life to make sure you get enough essential protein (without phenylalanine) and nutrients that are crucial for growth and general health\n\nA safe amount of phenylalanine differs for each person with PKU and can vary over time. In general, the idea is to consume only the amount of phenylalanine that's necessary for normal growth and body processes, but no more. Your doctor can determine a safe amount through:\n\n    Regular review of diet records, growth charts and blood levels of phenylalanine\n    Frequent blood tests that monitor phenylalanine levels as they change over time, especially during childhood growth spurts and pregnancy\n    Other tests that assess growth, development and health\n\nYour doctor may refer you to a registered dietitian who can help you learn about the PKU diet, make adjustments to your diet when needed, and offer suggestions on ways to manage PKU diet challenges.\n        \n            \n            Which foods to avoidBecause the amount of phenylalanine that a person with PKU can safely eat is so low, it's crucial to avoid all high-protein foods, such as:\n\n    Milk\n    Eggs\n    Cheese\n    Nuts\n    Soybeans\n    Beans\n    Chicken\n    Beef\n    Pork\n    Fish\n\nPotatoes, grains and other vegetables that have protein will likely be limited.\nChildren and adults also need to avoid certain other foods and beverages, including many diet sodas and other drinks that contain aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal). Aspartame is an artificial sweetener made with phenylalanine.\nSome medications may contain aspartame and some vitamins or other supplements may contain amino acids or skim milk powder. Check with your pharmacist about the contents of over-the-counter products or prescription medications.\nTalk with your doctor or registered dietitian to learn more about your specific dietary needs.\n        \n            \n            Formula for people with PKUBecause of the restricted diet, people with PKU need to get essential nutrients through a special nutritional supplement. The phenylalanine-free formula provides protein and other essential nutrients in a form that's safe for people with PKU.\nYour doctor and dietitian can help you find the right type of formula.\n\n    Formula for babies and toddlers. Because regular infant formula and breast milk contain phenylalanine, babies with PKU instead need to consume a phenylalanine-free infant formula. A dietitian can carefully calculate the amount of breast milk or regular formula to be added to the phenylalanine-free formula. Parents introduce solid foods with low levels of phenylalanine to children with PKU on the same schedule used for other infants.\n    Formula for older children and adults. Older children and adults continue to drink or eat a protein substitute formula daily, as directed by a doctor or dietitian. Your daily dose of formula is divided between your meals and snacks, instead of consumed all at once. The formula for older children and adults is not the same as the one used for infants, but it works on the same principle. It provides essential protein (amino acids) without phenylalanine and is continued for life.\n\nThe need for a nutritional supplement, especially if your child doesn't find it appealing, and the limited food choices can make the PKU diet challenging. But families need to make a firm commitment to this lifestyle change because it's the only way to prevent the serious health problems that people with PKU can develop.\n        \n            \n            Neutral amino acid therapyAnother possible addition to the PKU diet is a supplement called neutral amino acid therapy in powder or tablet form. This supplement may block some absorption of phenylalanine. This may be a treatment option for adults with PKU. Ask your doctor or dietitian if this supplement is appropriate for your diet.\n        \n            \n            PKU medicationThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the drug sapropterin (Kuvan) for the treatment of PKU. It works by increasing your tolerance to phenylalanine. The drug is for use in combination with a PKU diet.

Less often, bacterial infections cause sore throats.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Viral infectionsViral illnesses that cause a sore throat include:\n\n    Common cold\n    Flu (influenza)\n    Mono (mononucleosis)\n    Measles\n    Chickenpox\n    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n    Croup \u2014 a common childhood illness characterized by a harsh, barking cough\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Bacterial infectionsMany bacterial infections can cause a sore throat. The most common is Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) which causes strep throat.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Other causesOther causes of a sore throat include:\n\n    Allergies. Allergies to pet dander, molds, dust and pollen can cause a sore throat. The problem may be complicated by postnasal drip, which can irritate and inflame the throat.\n    Dryness. Dry indoor air can make your throat feel rough and scratchy. Breathing through your mouth \u2014 often because of chronic nasal congestion \u2014 also can cause a dry, sore throat.\n    Irritants. Outdoor air pollution and indoor pollution such as tobacco smoke or chemicals can cause a chronic sore throat. Chewing tobacco, drinking alcohol and eating spicy foods also can irritate your throat.\n    Muscle strain. You can strain muscles in your throat by yelling, talking loudly or talking for long periods without rest.\n    \n    Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a digestive system disorder in which stomach acids back up in the food pipe (esophagus).\n    Other signs or symptoms may include heartburn, hoarseness, regurgitation of stomach contents and the sensation of a lump in your throat.\n    \n    \n    HIV infection. A sore throat and other flu-like symptoms sometimes appear early after someone is infected with HIV.\n    Also, someone who is HIV-positive might have a chronic or recurring sore throat due to a fungal infection called oral thrush or due to a viral infection called cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can be serious in people with compromised immune systems.\n    \n    Tumors. Cancerous tumors of the throat, tongue or voice box (larynx) can cause a sore throat. Other signs or symptoms may include hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, noisy breathing, a lump in the neck, and blood in saliva or phlegm.\n\nRarely, an infected area of tissue (abscess) in the throat or swelling of the small cartilage \"lid\" that covers the windpipe (epiglottitis) can cause a sore throat. Both can block the airway, creating a medical emergency.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your or your child's doctor may review the symptoms and medical history. He or she may conduct a physical exam that includes:\n\n    Using a lighted instrument to look at the throat, and likely the ears and nasal passages\n    Gently feeling the neck to check for swollen glands (lymph nodes)\n    Listening to your or your child's breathing with a stethoscope\n\n        \n            \n            Throat swabIn many cases, doctors use a simple test to detect streptococcal bacteria, the cause of strep throat. The doctor rubs a sterile swab over the back of the throat to get a sample of secretions and sends the sample to a lab for testing. Many clinics are equipped with a lab that can get a test result for a rapid antigen test within a few minutes. However, a second, often more reliable test, called a throat culture, is sometimes sent to a lab that returns results within 24 to 48 hours.\nRapid antigen tests aren't as sensitive, although they can detect strep bacteria quickly. Because of this, the doctor may send a throat culture to a lab to test for strep throat if the antigen test comes back negative.\nIn some cases, doctors may use a molecular test to detect streptococcal bacteria. In this test, a doctor swipes a sterile swab over the back of the throat to get a sample of secretions. The sample is tested in a lab. Your or your child's doctor may have accurate results within a few minutes.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "A sore throat caused by a viral infection usually lasts five to seven days and doesn't usually require medical treatment. Antibiotics don't help treat a viral infection.\nTo ease pain and fever, many people turn to acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or other mild pain relievers.\nConsider giving your child over-the-counter pain medications designed for infants or children, such as acetaminophen (Children's Tylenol, FeverAll, others) or ibuprofen (Children's Advil, Children's Motrin, others), to ease symptoms.\nNever give aspirin to children or teenagers because it has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that causes swelling in the liver and brain.\n        \n            \n            Treating bacterial infectionsIf your or your child's sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection, your doctor or pediatrician will prescribe antibiotics.\nYou or your child must take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed even if the symptoms are gone. Failure to take all of the medication as directed can result in the infection worsening or spreading to other parts of the body.\nNot completing the full course of antibiotics to treat strep throat can increase a child's risk of rheumatic fever or serious kidney inflammation.\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist about what to do if you forget a dose.\n        \n            \n            Other treatmentsIf a sore throat is a symptom of a condition other than a viral or bacterial infection, other treatments will likely be considered depending on the diagnosis.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},
{"Diseases": "Whooping cough", "Symptoms": "Once you become infected with whooping cough, it takes about seven to 10 days for signs and symptoms to appear, though it can sometimes take longer.

Thick mucus accumulates inside your airways, causing uncontrollable coughing. Severe and prolonged coughing attacks may:\n\n    Provoke vomiting\n    Result in a red or blue face\n    Cause extreme fatigue\n    End with a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound during the next breath of air\n\nHowever, many people don't develop the characteristic whoop.

In most cases, the cause is a rupture (perforation) within the abdominal wall. Though it's rare, the condition can develop without an abdominal rupture.\nCommon causes of ruptures that lead to peritonitis include:\n\n    Medical procedures, such as peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis uses tubes (catheters) to remove waste products from your blood when your kidneys can no longer adequately do so. An infection may occur during peritoneal dialysis due to unclean surroundings, poor hygiene or contaminated equipment. Peritonitis may also develop as a complication of gastrointestinal surgery, the use of feeding tubes, or a procedure to withdraw fluid from your abdomen, and rarely as a complication of a colonoscopy or endoscopy.\n    A ruptured appendix, stomach ulcer or perforated colon. Any of these conditions can allow bacteria to get into the peritoneum through a hole in your gastrointestinal tract.\n    Pancreatitis. Inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis) complicated by infection may lead to peritonitis if the bacteria spreads outside the pancreas.\n    Diverticulitis. Infection of small, bulging pouches in your digestive tract (diverticulosis) may cause peritonitis if one of the pouches ruptures, spilling intestinal waste into your abdominal cavity.\n    Trauma. Injury or trauma may cause peritonitis by allowing bacteria or chemicals from other parts of your body to enter the peritoneum.\n\nPeritonitis that develops without an abdominal rupture (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) is usually a complication of liver disease, such as cirrhosis. Advanced cirrhosis causes a large amount of fluid buildup in your abdominal cavity.

A sample of your blood may be drawn and sent to a lab to check for a high white blood cell count. A blood culture also may be performed to determine if there are bacteria in your blood.\n    Imaging tests. Your doctor may want to use an X-ray to check for holes or other perforations in your gastrointestinal tract. Ultrasound also may be used. In some cases, your doctor may use a computerized tomography (CT) scan instead of an X-ray.\n    Peritoneal fluid analysis. Using a thin needle, your doctor may take a sample of the fluid in your peritoneum (paracentesis), especially if you receive peritoneal dialysis or have fluid in your abdomen from liver disease. If you have peritonitis, examination of this fluid may show an increased white blood cell count, which typically indicates an infection or inflammation. A culture of the fluid may also reveal the presence of bacteria.\n\nThe above tests may also be necessary if you're receiving peritoneal dialysis and a diagnosis of peritonitis is uncertain after a physical exam and an examination of the dialysis fluid.More InformationCT scanUltrasoundX-ray\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can be life-threatening.

The type and duration of your antibiotic therapy will depend on the severity of your condition and the kind of peritonitis you have. You may be given an antibiotic that treats a wide spectrum of bacteria until doctors have more information about the specific bacteria causing your infection. Then they can more narrowly target your antibiotic.\n    Surgery. Surgery is often needed to remove infected tissue, treat the underlying cause of the infection, and prevent the infection from spreading, especially if peritonitis is due to a ruptured appendix, stomach or colon.\n    Other treatments.

{"Diseases": "Perimenopause", "Symptoms": "Throughout the menopausal transition, some subtle \u2014 and some not-so-subtle \u2014 changes in your body may take place. You might experience:\n\n    Irregular periods. As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause.\n    Hot flashes and sleep problems. Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them.\n    Mood changes. Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. Mood changes may also be caused by factors not related to the hormonal changes of perimenopause.\n    Vaginal and bladder problems. When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence.\n    Decreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months.\n    Changes in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond.\n    Loss of bone. With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis \u2014 a disease that causes fragile bones.\n    Changing cholesterol levels. Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"bad\" cholesterol \u2014 which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"good\" cholesterol \u2014 decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorSome women seek medical attention for their perimenopausal symptoms.

Depending on your personal and family medical history, your doctor may recommend estrogen in the lowest dose needed to provide symptom relief for you. If you still have your uterus, you'll need progestin in addition to estrogen. Systemic estrogen can help prevent bone loss. \n    Vaginal estrogen. Estrogen can be administered directly to the vagina using a vaginal tablet, ring or cream. This treatment releases just a small amount of estrogen, which is absorbed by the vaginal tissue. It can help relieve vaginal dryness, discomfort with intercourse and some urinary symptoms. \n    Antidepressants. Certain antidepressants related to the class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may reduce menopausal hot flashes. An antidepressant for management of hot flashes may be useful for women who can't take estrogen for health reasons or for women who need an antidepressant for a mood disorder. \n    Gabapentin (Neurontin). Gabapentin is approved to treat seizures, but it has also been shown to help reduce hot flashes. This drug is useful for women who can't use estrogen therapy for health reasons and for those who also have migraines. \n\nBefore deciding on any form of treatment, talk with your doctor about your options and the risks and benefits involved with each.

The acid can create a painful open sore that may bleed.\nYour digestive tract is coated with a mucous layer that normally protects against acid. But if the amount of acid is increased or the amount of mucus is decreased, you could develop an ulcer.\nCommon causes include:\n\n    \n    A bacterium. Helicobacter pylori bacteria commonly live in the mucous layer that covers and protects tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. Often, the H. pylori bacterium causes no problems, but it can cause inflammation of the stomach's inner layer, producing an ulcer.\n    It's not clear how H. pylori infection spreads. It may be transmitted from person to person by close contact, such as kissing. People may also contract H. pylori through food and water.\n    \n    Regular use of certain pain relievers. Taking aspirin, as well as certain over-the-counter and prescription pain medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , can irritate or inflame the lining of your stomach and small intestine. These medications include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox DS, others), ketoprofen and others. They do not include acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).\n    Other medications. Taking certain other medications along with NSAIDs, such as steroids, anticoagulants, low-dose aspirin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), alendronate (Fosamax) and risedronate (Actonel), can greatly increase the chance of developing ulcers.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Endoscopy\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tEndoscopy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEndoscopy\n\t\t\t\tAn endoscopy procedure involves inserting a long, flexible tube (endoscope) down your throat and into your esophagus. A tiny camera on the end of the endoscope lets your doctor examine your esophagus, stomach and the beginning of your small intestine (duodenum).\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nTo detect an ulcer, your doctor may first take a medical history and perform a physical exam. You then may need to undergo diagnostic tests, such as:\n\n    \n    Laboratory tests for H. pylori. Your doctor may recommend tests to determine whether the bacterium H. pylori is present in your body. He or she may look for H. pylori using a blood, stool or breath test. The breath test is the most accurate.\n    For the breath test, you drink or eat something that contains radioactive carbon. H. pylori breaks down the substance in your stomach. Later, you blow into a bag, which is then sealed. If you're infected with H. pylori, your breath sample will contain the radioactive carbon in the form of carbon dioxide.\n    If you are taking an antacid prior to the testing for H. pylori, make sure to let your doctor know. Depending on which test is used, you may need to discontinue the medication for a period of time because antacids can lead to false-negative results.\n    \n    \n    Endoscopy. Your doctor may use a scope to examine your upper digestive system (endoscopy). During endoscopy, your doctor passes a hollow tube equipped with a lens (endoscope) down your throat and into your esophagus, stomach and small intestine. Using the endoscope, your doctor looks for ulcers.\n    If your doctor detects an ulcer, a small tissue sample (biopsy) may be removed for examination in a lab. A biopsy can also identify whether H. pylori is in your stomach lining.\n    Your doctor is more likely to recommend endoscopy if you are older, have signs of bleeding, or have experienced recent weight loss or difficulty eating and swallowing. If the endoscopy shows an ulcer in your stomach, a follow-up endoscopy should be performed after treatment to show that it has healed, even if your symptoms improve.\n    \n    Upper gastrointestinal series. Sometimes called a barium swallow, this series of X-rays of your upper digestive system creates images of your esophagus, stomach and small intestine. During the X-ray, you swallow a white liquid (containing barium) that coats your digestive tract and makes an ulcer more visible.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your peptic ulcer-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationPeptic ulcer care at Mayo ClinicNeedle biopsyUpper endoscopyX-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for peptic ulcers depends on the cause. Usually treatment will involve killing the H. pylori bacterium if present, eliminating or reducing use of NSAIDs if possible, and helping your ulcer to heal with medication.\nMedications can include:\n\n    \n    Antibiotic medications to kill H. pylori. If H. pylori is found in your digestive tract, your doctor may recommend a combination of antibiotics to kill the bacterium. These may include amoxicillin (Amoxil), clarithromycin (Biaxin), metronidazole (Flagyl), tinidazole (Tindamax), tetracycline and levofloxacin.\n    The antibiotics used will be determined by where you live and current antibiotic resistance rates. You'll likely need to take antibiotics for two weeks, as well as additional medications to reduce stomach acid, including a proton pump inhibitor and possibly bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol).\n    \n    \n    Medications that block acid production and promote healing. Proton pump inhibitors \u2014 also called PPIs \u2014 reduce stomach acid by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. These drugs include the prescription and over-the-counter medications omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), esomeprazole (Nexium) and pantoprazole (Protonix).\n    Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors, particularly at high doses, may increase your risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture. Ask your doctor whether a calcium supplement may reduce this risk.\n    \n    \n    Medications to reduce acid production. Acid blockers \u2014 also called histamine (H-2) blockers \u2014 reduce the amount of stomach acid released into your digestive tract, which relieves ulcer pain and encourages healing.\n    Available by prescription or over the counter, acid blockers include the medications famotidine (Pepcid AC), cimetidine (Tagamet HB) and nizatidine (Axid AR).\n    \n    \n    Antacids that neutralize stomach acid. Your doctor may include an antacid in your drug regimen. Antacids neutralize existing stomach acid and can provide rapid pain relief. Side effects can include constipation or diarrhea, depending on the main ingredients.\n    Antacids can provide symptom relief but generally aren't used to heal your ulcer.\n    \n    \n    Medications that protect the lining of your stomach and small intestine. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe medications called cytoprotective agents that help protect the tissues that line your stomach and small intestine.\n    Options include the prescription medications sucralfate (Carafate) and misoprostol (Cytotec).\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Follow-up after initial treatmentTreatment for peptic ulcers is often successful, leading to ulcer healing. But if your symptoms are severe or if they continue despite treatment, your doctor may recommend endoscopy to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms.\nIf an ulcer is detected during endoscopy, your doctor may recommend another endoscopy after your treatment to make sure your ulcer has healed. Ask your doctor whether you should undergo follow-up tests after your treatment.\n        \n            \n            Ulcers that fail to healPeptic ulcers that don't heal with treatment are called refractory ulcers. There are many reasons why an ulcer may fail to heal, including:\n\n    Not taking medications according to directions\n    The fact that some types of H. pylori are resistant to antibiotics\n    Regular use of tobacco\n    Regular use of pain relievers \u2014 such as NSAIDs \u2014 that increase the risk of ulcers\n\nLess often, refractory ulcers may be a result of:\n\n    Extreme overproduction of stomach acid, such as occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome\n    An infection other than H. pylori\n    Stomach cancer\n    Other diseases that may cause ulcerlike sores in the stomach and small intestine, such as Crohn's disease\n\nTreatment for refractory ulcers generally involves eliminating factors that may interfere with healing, along with using different antibiotics.\nIf you have a serious complication from an ulcer, such as acute bleeding or a perforation, you may require surgery.

{"Diseases": "Pemphigus", "Symptoms": "Pemphigus causes blisters on your skin and mucous membranes. The blisters rupture easily, leaving open sores, which may ooze and become infected.\nThe signs and symptoms of two common types of pemphigus are as follows:\n\n    Pemphigus vulgaris. This type usually begins with blisters in your mouth and then on your skin or genital mucous membranes. The blisters typically are painful but don't itch. Blisters in your mouth or throat may make it hard to swallow and eat.\n    Pemphigus foliaceus. This type causes blisters on the chest, back and shoulders. The blisters tend to be more itchy than painful. Pemphigus foliaceus doesn't cause mouth blisters.\n\nPemphigus is distinct from bullous pemphigoid, which is a blistering skin condition that affects older adults and may cause death.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorSee your doctor if you have blisters inside your mouth or on your skin that don't heal.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder. Normally, your immune system produces antibodies to fight off harmful invaders, such viruses and bacteria. But in pemphigus, the body produces antibodies that damage cells of your skin and mucous membranes.\nPemphigus isn't contagious. In most cases, it's unknown what triggers the disease.\nRarely, pemphigus is triggered by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, penicillamine and other drugs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Blisters occur with a number of more common conditions, so pemphigus, which is rare, can be difficult to diagnose. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist in skin conditions (dermatologist).\nYour doctor will talk with you about your medical history and examine your skin and mouth. In addition, you may undergo tests, including:\n\n    A skin biopsy. In this test, a piece of tissue from a blister is removed and examined under a microscope.\n    Blood tests. One purpose of these tests is to detect and identify antibodies in your blood that are known to be present with pemphigus.\n    An endoscopy. If you have pemphigus vulgaris, your doctor may have you undergo endoscopy to check for sores in the throat. This procedure involves inserting a flexible tube (endoscope) down your throat.\nMore InformationSkin biopsy\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment usually begins with medications that are intended to suppress blister formation. It's generally more effective when it begins as early as possible. If use of a drug triggered your condition, stopping use of it may be enough to clear up your pemphigus.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsThe following prescription medications may be used alone or in combination, depending on the type and severity of your pemphigus and whether you have other medical conditions:\n\n    \n    Corticosteroids. For people with mild disease, corticosteroid cream may be enough to control it. For others, the mainstay of treatment is an oral corticosteroid, such as prednisone pills.\n    Using corticosteroids for a long time or in high doses may cause serious side effects, including diabetes, bone loss, an increased risk of infection, stomach ulcers and a redistribution of body fat, leading to a round face (moon face).\n    \n    Steroid-sparing immunosuppressant drugs. Medications such as azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), mycophenolate (Cellcept) and cyclophosphamide help keep your immune system from attacking healthy tissue. They may have serious side effects, including increased risk of infection.\n    Other medications. If first-line drugs aren't helping you, your doctor may suggest another drug, such as dapsone, intravenous immunoglobulin or rituximab (Rituxan).\n\nMany people get better with treatment, although it may take years. Others need to take a lower dose of medication indefinitely to prevent their signs and symptoms from returning.

Your doctor might recommend:\n\n    Self-care measures. If your uterine prolapse causes few or no symptoms, simple self-care measures may provide relief or help prevent worsening prolapse. Self-care measures include performing Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic muscles, losing weight and treating constipation.\n    Pessary. A vaginal pessary is a plastic or rubber ring inserted into your vagina to support the bulging tissues. A pessary must be removed regularly for cleaning.\n\n        \n            \n            SurgeryYour doctor might recommend surgery to repair uterine prolapse. Minimally invasive (laparoscopic) or vaginal surgery might be an option.\nSurgery can involve:\n\n    Repair of weakened pelvic floor tissues. This surgery is generally approached through the vagina but sometimes through the abdomen. The surgeon might graft your own tissue, donor tissue or a synthetic material onto weakened pelvic floor structures to support your pelvic organs.\n    Removal of your uterus (hysterectomy). Hysterectomy might be recommended for uterine prolapse in certain instances. A hysterectomy is generally very safe, but with any surgery comes the risk of complications.\n\nTalk with your doctor about all your treatment options to be sure you understand the risks and benefits of each so that you can choose what's best for you.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing.\nThe degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded.\nBecause pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression.

Catheter procedures can also be used to treat full-term babies, children and adults.\n    In a catheter procedure, a thin tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and threaded up to the heart. Through the catheter, a plug or coil is inserted to close the ductus arteriosus.\n    If the procedure is done on an outpatient basis, you or your child probably won't stay overnight in the hospital. Complications from catheter procedures include bleeding, infection, or movement of the plug or coil from where it was placed in the heart.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Preventive antibioticsIn the past, people who've had a PDA were advised to take antibiotics before dental work and certain surgical procedures, to prevent endocarditis. Today, preventive antibiotics are no longer recommended for most people with a patent ductus arteriosus.\nYou or your child may need to take preventive antibiotics the first six months after a catheter repair procedure, if there's still damage after the repair, or if you had an infection in the heart previously. Talk to your doctor about whether you or your child needs to take antibiotics before any procedures.\n        \n            \n            Needed follow-up careIf you have a PDA, even if you had surgery as a child, you may be at risk of developing complications as an adult. So it's important to have lifelong follow-up care, especially if you had corrective heart surgery.\nThis follow-up care could be as simple as having periodic checkups with your doctor, or it may involve regular screenings for complications. The important thing is to discuss your care plan with your doctor and make sure you follow all of your doctor's recommendations.\nIdeally, a cardiologist trained in treating adults with congenital heart defects will manage your care.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

A tremor, or shaking, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth, known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest.\n    Slowed movement (bradykinesia). Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you walk. It may be difficult to get out of a chair. You may drag your feet as you try to walk.\n    Rigid muscles. Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body. The stiff muscles can be painful and limit your range of motion.\n    Impaired posture and balance. Your posture may become stooped, or you may have balance problems as a result of Parkinson's disease.\n    Loss of automatic movements. You may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk.\n    Speech changes. You may speak softly, quickly, slur or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be more of a monotone rather than have the usual inflections.\n    Writing changes.

Many of the symptoms are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine. When dopamine levels decrease, it causes abnormal brain activity, leading to impaired movement and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nThe cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors appear to play a role, including:\n\n    \n    Genes. Researchers have identified specific genetic mutations that can cause Parkinson's disease. But these are uncommon except in rare cases with many family members affected by Parkinson's disease.\n    However, certain gene variations appear to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease but with a relatively small risk of Parkinson's disease for each of these genetic markers.\n    \n    Environmental triggers. Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may increase the risk of later Parkinson's disease, but the risk is relatively small.\n\nResearchers have also noted that many changes occur in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease, although it's not clear why these changes occur. These changes include:\n\n    The presence of Lewy bodies. Clumps of specific substances within brain cells are microscopic markers of Parkinson's disease. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these Lewy bodies hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease.\n    Alpha-synuclein found within Lewy bodies. Although many substances are found within Lewy bodies, scientists believe an important one is the natural and widespread protein called alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein). It's found in all Lewy bodies in a clumped form that cells can't break down. This is currently an important focus among Parkinson's disease researchers.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "No specific test exists to diagnose Parkinson's disease. Your doctor trained in nervous system conditions (neurologist) will diagnose Parkinson's disease based on your medical history, a review of your signs and symptoms, and a neurological and physical examination.\nYour doctor may suggest a specific single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan called a dopamine transporter scan (DaTscan). Although this can help support the suspicion that you have Parkinson's disease, it is your symptoms and neurologic examination that ultimately determine the correct diagnosis. Most people do not require a DaTscan .\nYour doctor may order lab tests, such as blood tests, to rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms.\nImaging tests \u2014 such as an MRI, ultrasound of the brain, and PET scans \u2014 also may be used to help rule out other disorders. Imaging tests aren't particularly helpful for diagnosing Parkinson's disease.\nIn addition to your examination, your doctor may give you carbidopa-levodopa (Rytary, Sinemet, others), a Parkinson's disease medication. You must be given a sufficient dose to show the benefit, as low doses for a day or two aren't reliable. Significant improvement with this medication will often confirm your diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.\nSometimes it takes time to diagnose Parkinson's disease. Doctors may recommend regular follow-up appointments with neurologists trained in movement disorders to evaluate your condition and symptoms over time and diagnose Parkinson's disease.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Parkinson's disease-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Parkinson's disease can't be cured, but medications can help control your symptoms, often dramatically. In some more advanced cases, surgery may be advised.\nYour doctor may also recommend lifestyle changes, especially ongoing aerobic exercise. In some cases, physical therapy that focuses on balance and stretching also is important. A speech-language pathologist may help improve your speech problems.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsMedications may help you manage problems with walking, movement and tremor. These medications increase or substitute for dopamine.\nPeople with Parkinson's disease have low brain dopamine concentrations. However, dopamine can't be given directly, as it can't enter your brain.\nYou may have significant improvement of your symptoms after beginning Parkinson's disease treatment. Over time, however, the benefits of drugs frequently diminish or become less consistent. You can usually still control your symptoms fairly well.\nMedications your doctor may prescribe include:\n\n\t\n\tCarbidopa-levodopa. Levodopa, the most effective Parkinson's disease medication, is a natural chemical that passes into your brain and is converted to dopamine.\n\tLevodopa is combined with carbidopa (Lodosyn), which protects levodopa from early conversion to dopamine outside your brain. This prevents or lessens side effects such as nausea.\n\tSide effects may include nausea or lightheadedness (orthostatic hypotension).\n\tAfter years, as your disease progresses, the benefit from levodopa may become less stable, with a tendency to wax and wane (\"wearing off\").\n\tAlso, you may experience involuntary movements (dyskinesia) after taking higher doses of levodopa. Your doctor may lessen your dose or adjust the times of your doses to control these effects.\n\t\n\tInhaled carbidopa-levodopa. Inbrija is a new brand-name drug delivering carbidopa-levodopa in an inhaled form. It may be helpful in managing symptoms that arise when oral medications suddenly stop working during the day.\n\t\n\tCarbidopa-levodopa infusion. Duopa is a brand-name medication made up of carbidopa and levodopa. However, it's administered through a feeding tube that delivers the medication in a gel form directly to the small intestine.\n\tDuopa is for patients with more-advanced Parkinson's who still respond to carbidopa-levodopa, but who have a lot of fluctuations in their response. Because Duopa is continually infused, blood levels of the two drugs remain constant.\n\tPlacement of the tube requires a small surgical procedure. Risks associated with having the tube include the tube falling out or infections at the infusion site.\n\t\n\t\n\tDopamine agonists. Unlike levodopa, dopamine agonists don't change into dopamine. Instead, they mimic dopamine effects in your brain.\n\tThey aren't as effective as levodopa in treating your symptoms. However, they last longer and may be used with levodopa to smooth the sometimes off-and-on effect of levodopa.\n\tDopamine agonists include pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip) and rotigotine (Neupro, given as a patch). Apomorphine (Apokyn) is a short-acting injectable dopamine agonist used for quick relief.\n\tSome of the side effects of dopamine agonists are similar to the side effects of carbidopa-levodopa. But they can also include hallucinations, sleepiness and compulsive behaviors such as hypersexuality, gambling and eating. If you're taking these medications and you behave in a way that's out of character for you, talk to your doctor.\n\t\n\t\n\tMAO B inhibitors. These medications include selegiline (Zelapar), rasagiline (Azilect) and safinamide (Xadago). They help prevent the breakdown of brain dopamine by inhibiting the brain enzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO B). This enzyme metabolizes brain dopamine. Selegiline given with levodopa may help prevent wearing-off.\n\tSide effects of MAO B inhibitors may include headaches, nausea or insomnia. When added to carbidopa-levodopa, these medications increase the risk of hallucinations.\n\tThese medications are not often used in combination with most antidepressants or certain narcotics due to potentially serious but rare reactions. Check with your doctor before taking any additional medications with an MAO B inhibitor.\n\t\n\t\n\tCatechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors. Entacapone (Comtan) and opicapone (Ongentys) are the primary medications from this class. This medication mildly prolongs the effect of levodopa therapy by blocking an enzyme that breaks down dopamine.\n\tSide effects, including an increased risk of involuntary movements (dyskinesia), mainly result from an enhanced levodopa effect. Other side effects include diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.\n\tTolcapone (Tasmar) is another COMT inhibitor that is rarely prescribed due to a risk of serious liver damage and liver failure.\n\t\n\t\n\tAnticholinergics. These medications were used for many years to help control the tremor associated with Parkinson's disease. Several anticholinergic medications are available, including benztropine (Cogentin) or trihexyphenidyl.\n\tHowever, their modest benefits are often offset by side effects such as impaired memory, confusion, hallucinations, constipation, dry mouth and impaired urination.\n\t\n\t\n\tAmantadine. Doctors may prescribe amantadine alone to provide short-term relief of symptoms of mild, early-stage Parkinson's disease. It may also be given with carbidopa-levodopa therapy during the later stages of Parkinson's disease to control involuntary movements (dyskinesia) induced by carbidopa-levodopa.\n\tSide effects may include a purple mottling of the skin, ankle swelling or hallucinations.\n\t\n\n        \n            \n            Surgical procedures\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Deep brain stimulation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDeep brain stimulation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDeep brain stimulation\n\t\t\t\tDeep brain stimulation involves implanting an electrode deep within your brain. The amount of stimulation delivered by the electrode is controlled by a pacemaker-like device placed under the skin in your chest. A wire that travels under your skin connects the device to the electrode.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nDeep brain stimulation. In deep brain stimulation (DBS), surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of your brain. The electrodes are connected to a generator implanted in your chest near your collarbone that sends electrical pulses to your brain and may reduce your Parkinson's disease symptoms.\nYour doctor may adjust your settings as necessary to treat your condition. Surgery involves risks, including infections, strokes or brain hemorrhage. Some people experience problems with the DBS system or have complications due to stimulation, and your doctor may need to adjust or replace some parts of the system.\nDeep brain stimulation is most often offered to people with advanced Parkinson's disease who have unstable medication (levodopa) responses. DBS can stabilize medication fluctuations, reduce or halt involuntary movements (dyskinesia), reduce tremor, reduce rigidity, and improve slowing of movement.\nDBS is effective in controlling erratic and fluctuating responses to levodopa or for controlling dyskinesia that doesn't improve with medication adjustments.\nHowever, DBS isn't helpful for problems that don't respond to levodopa therapy apart from a tremor. A tremor may be controlled by DBS even if the tremor isn't very responsive to levodopa.\nAlthough DBS may provide sustained benefit for Parkinson's symptoms, it doesn't keep Parkinson's disease from progressing.\nBecause there have been infrequent reports that the DBS therapy affects the movements needed for swimming, the Food and Drug Administration recommends consulting with your doctor and taking water safety precautions before swimming.More InformationParkinson's disease care at Mayo ClinicAcupunctureDeep brain stimulationMassage therapyMeditationShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Psychotherapy can help you understand panic attacks and panic disorder and learn how to cope with them.\nA form of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy can help you learn, through your own experience, that panic symptoms are not dangerous. Your therapist will help you gradually re-create the symptoms of a panic attack in a safe, repetitive manner. Once the physical sensations of panic no longer feel threatening, the attacks begin to resolve. Successful treatment can also help you overcome fears of situations that you've avoided because of panic attacks.\nSeeing results from treatment can take time and effort.

Several types of medication have been shown to be effective in managing symptoms of panic attacks, including:\n\n    Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Generally safe with a low risk of serious side effects, SSRI antidepressants are typically recommended as the first choice of medications to treat panic attacks. SSRIs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of panic disorder include fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) and sertraline (Zoloft).\n    Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). These medications are another class of antidepressants. The SNRI venlafaxine (Effexor XR) is FDA approved for the treatment of panic disorder.\n    Benzodiazepines. These sedatives are central nervous system depressants. Benzodiazepines approved by the FDA for the treatment of panic disorder include alprazolam (Xanax) and clonazepam (Klonopin). Benzodiazepines are generally used only on a short-term basis because they can be habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. These medications are not a good choice if you've had problems with alcohol or drug use. They can also interact with other drugs, causing dangerous side effects.\n\nIf one medication doesn't work well for you, your doctor may recommend switching to another or combining certain medications to boost effectiveness. Keep in mind that it can take several weeks after first starting a medication to notice an improvement in symptoms.\nAll medications have a risk of side effects, and some may not be recommended in certain situations, such as pregnancy.

On average, signs and symptoms occur for several months before a diagnosis is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

Here, a biopsy of a suspicious breast lump is being done. The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nTests and procedures used to diagnose Paget's disease of the breast include:\n\n    Breast exam. Your doctor will check both of your breasts and the lymph nodes in your armpit, feeling for any lumps or other abnormalities.\n    Mammogram. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. Mammograms are commonly used to screen for breast cancer. If an abnormality is detected on a screening mammogram, your doctor may recommend a diagnostic mammogram to further evaluate that abnormality.\n    Breast ultrasound. Ultrasound uses sound waves to produce images of structures deep within the body. Ultrasound may be used to determine whether a new breast lump is a solid mass or a fluid-filled cyst.\n    Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI machine uses a magnet and radio waves to create pictures of the interior of your breast. Before a breast MRI, you receive an injection of dye.\n    Removing a sample of breast cells for testing (biopsy). During a biopsy, your doctor removes a sample of suspicious tissue. Biopsy samples are sent to a laboratory for analysis to determine whether the cells are cancerous. A biopsy sample is also analyzed to determine the type of cells involved in the breast cancer, the aggressiveness (grade) of the cancer, and whether the cancer cells have hormone receptors or other receptors that may influence your treatment options.\n\nOther tests and procedures may be used depending on your situation.More InformationBreast biopsyBreast MRIBreast self-exam for breast awarenessMammogramMRISentinel node biopsyX-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Mastectomy\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMastectomy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMastectomy\n\t\t\t\tDuring a total (simple) mastectomy, the surgeon removes the breast tissue, nipple, areola and skin.

The nodes are removed and tested for signs of cancer.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nIf you have Paget's disease of the breast, you will likely need surgery. The type of surgery depends on the condition of the skin around your nipple and how advanced the underlying cancer is.\nSurgical options include:\n\n    Removing the entire breast (mastectomy). A mastectomy is an operation to remove all of your breast tissue. Most mastectomy procedures remove all of the breast tissue \u2014 the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue and some skin, including the nipple and areola (total or simple mastectomy).\n    Removing the breast cancer (lumpectomy). During a lumpectomy, which may be referred to as breast-conserving surgery or wide local excision, the surgeon removes the cancer and a small margin of surrounding healthy tissue. If you and your doctor choose this option, you will also receive radiation therapy afterward.\n    \n    Removing a limited number of lymph nodes (sentinel node biopsy). To determine whether cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, your surgeon will discuss with you the role of removing the lymph nodes that are the first to receive the lymph drainage from your cancer.\n    If no cancer is found in those lymph nodes, the chance of finding cancer in any of the remaining lymph nodes is small and no other nodes need to be removed.\n    \n    Removing several lymph nodes (axillary lymph node dissection). If cancer is found in the sentinel lymph nodes, your surgeon will discuss with you the role of removing additional lymph nodes in your armpit.\n    Removing both breasts. Some people with cancer in one breast may choose to have their other (healthy) breast removed (contralateral prophylactic mastectomy) if they have a very increased risk of cancer in the other breast because of a genetic predisposition or strong family history.\n\nYou may choose to have breast reconstruction after surgery. Discuss your options and preferences with your surgeon.\nConsider a referral to a plastic surgeon before your surgery.

{"Diseases": "Paget's disease of bone", "Symptoms": "Most people who have Paget's disease of bone have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, the most common complaint is bone pain.\nBecause this disease causes your body to generate new bone faster than normal, the rapid remodeling produces bone that's less organized and weaker than normal bone, which can lead to bone pain, deformities and fractures.\nThe disease might affect only one or two areas of your body or might be widespread. Your signs and symptoms, if any, will depend on the affected part of your body.\n\n    Pelvis. Paget's disease of bone in the pelvis can cause hip pain.\n    Skull. An overgrowth of bone in the skull can cause hearing loss or headaches.\n    Spine. If your spine is affected, nerve roots can become compressed. This can cause pain, tingling and numbness in an arm or leg.\n    Leg. As the bones weaken, they may bend \u2014 causing you to become bowlegged. Enlarged and misshapen bones in your legs can put extra stress on nearby joints, which may cause osteoarthritis in your knee or hip.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorTalk to your doctor if you have:\n\n    Pain in your bones and joints\n    Tingling and weakness in an extremity\n    Bone deformities\n    Unexplained hearing loss, especially if it's only on one side\n\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The cause of Paget's disease of bone is unknown. Scientists suspect a combination of environmental and genetic factors contribute to the disease. Several genes appear to be linked to getting the disease.\nSome scientists believe Paget's disease of bone is related to a viral infection in your bone cells, but this theory is controversial.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During the physical exam, your doctor will examine areas of your body that are causing you pain. He or she may also order X-rays and blood tests that can help confirm the diagnosis of Paget's disease of bone.\n        \n            \n            Imaging testsBone changes can be revealed by:\n\n    X-rays. The first indication of Paget's disease of bone is often abnormalities found on X-rays done for other reasons. X-ray images of your bones can show areas of bone breakdown, enlargement of the bone and deformities that are characteristic of the disease, such as bowing of your long bones.\n    Bone scan. In a bone scan, radioactive material is injected into your body. This material travels to the spots on your bones most affected, and they light up on the scan images.\n\n        \n            \n            Lab testsPeople who have Paget's disease of bone usually have elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase in their blood, which can be revealed by a blood test.More InformationBone scanX-ray\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "If you don't have symptoms, you might not need treatment. However, if the disease is active \u2014 indicated by an elevated alkaline phosphatase level \u2014 and is affecting high-risk sites in your body, such as your skull or spine, your doctor might recommend treatment to prevent complications, even if you don't have symptoms.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsOsteoporosis drugs (bisphosphonates) are the most common treatment for Paget's disease of bone. Bisphosphonates are typically given by injection into a vein, but they can also be taken by mouth. When taken orally, bisphosphonates are generally well tolerated but can irritate the stomach.\nBisphosphonates that are given intravenously include:\n\n    Zoledronic acid (Zometa, Reclast)\n    Pamidronate (Aredia)\n    Ibandronate (Boniva)\n\nOral bisphosphonates include:\n\n    Alendronate (Fosamax, Binosto)\n    Risedronate (Actonel, Atelvia)\n\nRarely, bisphosphonate therapy has been linked to severe muscle, joint or bone pain, which might not resolve when the medication is discontinued. Bisphosphonates can also increase the risk of a rare condition in which a section of jawbone dies and deteriorates, usually associated with active dental disease or oral surgery.\nIf you can't tolerate bisphosphonates, your doctor might prescribe calcitonin (Miacalcin), a naturally occurring hormone involved in calcium regulation and bone metabolism. Calcitonin is a drug that you administer to yourself by injection or nasal spray. Side effects may include nausea, facial flushing and irritation at the injection site.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryIn rare cases, surgery might be required to:\n\n    Help fractures heal\n    Replace joints damaged by severe arthritis\n    Realign deformed bones\n    Reduce pressure on nerves\n\nPaget's disease of bone often causes the body to produce too many blood vessels in the affected bones, increasing the risk of serious blood loss during an operation.\nIf you're scheduled for surgery that involves bones affected by Paget's disease of bone, your doctor might prescribe medications to reduce the activity of the disease, which may help reduce blood loss during surgery.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

In the congenital form, the calf muscle or nearby artery is abnormally positioned while the baby grows in the mother's womb. People with the acquired form of PAES have a calf muscle that is bigger than normal (enlarged).\n\nThe abnormal calf muscle presses on the main artery behind the knee (popliteal artery), reducing blood flow to the lower leg. The lack of blood flow results in pain and cramping in the back of the lower leg during times of activity.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will carefully examine you and ask questions about your symptoms and health history. However, because most people with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) are young and usually healthy, diagnosing the condition can sometimes be challenging. The findings from a physical exam usually are normal.\n\nYour doctor will rule out other causes of leg pain, including muscle strains, stress fractures, chronic exertional compartment syndrome and peripheral artery disease, which results from clogged arteries.\n\nTests used to rule out other conditions and diagnose PAES include the following:\n\n\nAnkle-brachial index (ABI) measurement is usually the first test done to diagnose PAES. Blood pressure measurements are taken in your arms and legs during and after walking on a treadmill. The ABI is determined by dividing ankle pressure by arm pressure. The blood pressure in your legs should be higher than that in your arms. But if you have PAES, your ankle pressure drops during exercise.\nDuplex ultrasound of the calf uses high-frequency sound waves to determine how fast blood is flowing through the leg arteries. This noninvasive test may be done before or after exercise or while you flex your foot up and down, which puts your calf muscle to work.\nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) shows the calf muscle that is trapping the artery. It can also reveal how much of the popliteal artery is narrowed. You may be asked to flex your foot or press it against a board during this test. Doing so helps your doctor determine how blood is flowing to your lower leg.\nCT angiography also shows which leg muscle is causing the artery entrapment.

Your doctor will likely recommend surgery if your symptoms significantly affect your everyday or athletic activities.\n\nDuring surgery, the surgeon makes an incision on the inner calf just below the knee, or in the back of the knee, to release the abnormal calf muscle and give the artery more room. This will prevent the calf muscle from pressing on the artery in the future. Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia. The procedure takes about an hour. Typically, you'll need to stay in the hospital for one day.\n\nIf you've had the condition for a long time, you may need artery bypass surgery. Bypass surgery is usually done only on those who have severe narrowing of the artery (stenosis) due to long-term popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.\n\nSurgery to release the calf muscle and artery usually doesn't affect leg function. When the condition is diagnosed and treated early, a full recovery is expected, and your symptoms should disappear.\n        \n            \n    "},
{"Diseases": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD)", "Symptoms": "While many people with peripheral artery disease have mild or no symptoms, some people have leg pain when walking (claudication).\nClaudication symptoms include muscle pain or cramping in your legs or arms that's triggered by activity, such as walking, but disappears after a few minutes of rest. The location of the pain depends on the location of the clogged or narrowed artery. Calf pain is the most common location.\nThe severity of claudication varies widely, from mild discomfort to debilitating pain. Severe claudication can make it hard for you to walk or do other types of physical activity.\nPeripheral artery disease signs and symptoms include:\n\n    Painful cramping in one or both of your hips, thighs or calf muscles after certain activities, such as walking or climbing stairs\n    Leg numbness or weakness\n    Coldness in your lower leg or foot, especially when compared with the other side\n    Sores on your toes, feet or legs that won't heal\n    A change in the color of your legs\n    Hair loss or slower hair growth on your feet and legs\n    Slower growth of your toenails\n    Shiny skin on your legs\n    No pulse or a weak pulse in your legs or feet\n    Erectile dysfunction in men\n    Pain when using your arms, such as aching and cramping when knitting, writing or doing other manual tasks\n\nIf peripheral artery disease progresses, pain may even occur when you're at rest or when you're lying down. It may be intense enough to disrupt sleep. Hanging your legs over the edge of your bed or walking around your room may temporarily relieve the pain.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorIf you have leg pain, numbness or other symptoms, don't dismiss them as a normal part of aging.

These plaques can also burst, causing a blood clot to form.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeripheral artery disease is often caused by atherosclerosis. In atherosclerosis, fatty deposits build up on your artery walls and reduce blood flow.\nAlthough discussions of atherosclerosis usually focus on the heart, the disease can and usually does affect arteries throughout your body. When it occurs in the arteries supplying blood to your limbs, it causes peripheral artery disease.\nLess commonly, the cause of peripheral artery disease may be blood vessel inflammation, injury to your limbs, unusual anatomy of your ligaments or muscles, or radiation exposure.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Some of the tests your doctor may rely on to diagnose peripheral artery disease are:\n\n    Physical exam. Your doctor may find signs of PAD during a physical exam, such as a weak or absent pulse below a narrowed area of your artery, whooshing sounds over your arteries that can be heard with a stethoscope, evidence of poor wound healing in the area where your blood flow is restricted, and decreased blood pressure in your affected limb.\n    \n    Ankle-brachial index (ABI). This is a common test used to diagnose PAD. It compares the blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm.\n    To get a blood pressure reading, your doctor uses a regular blood pressure cuff and a special ultrasound device to evaluate blood pressure and flow.\n    You may walk on a treadmill and have readings taken before and immediately after exercising to capture the severity of the narrowed arteries during walking.\n    \n    Ultrasound. Special ultrasound imaging techniques, such as Doppler ultrasound, can help your doctor evaluate blood flow through your blood vessels and identify blocked or narrowed arteries.\n    \n    Angiography. Using a dye injected into your blood vessels, this test allows your doctor to view blood flow through your arteries as it happens. Your doctor can trace the flow of the dye using imaging techniques, such as X-rays, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computerized tomography angiography.\n    Catheter angiography is an invasive procedure that involves guiding a small hollow tube (catheter) through an artery in your groin to the affected area and injecting the dye. This type of angiography allows your doctor to treat a blocked blood vessel at the time of diagnosis. After finding the narrowed area of a blood vessel, your doctor can then widen it by inserting and expanding a tiny balloon or by administering medication that improves blood flow.\n    \n    Blood tests. A sample of your blood can be used to measure your cholesterol and triglycerides and to check for diabetes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Peripheral artery disease (PAD)-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationPeripheral artery disease (PAD) care at Mayo ClinicAnkle-brachial indexCT coronary angiogramUltrasoundShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for peripheral artery disease has two major goals:\n\n    Manage symptoms, such as leg pain, so that you can resume physical activities\n    Stop the progression of atherosclerosis throughout your body to reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke\n\nYou may be able to accomplish these goals with lifestyle changes, especially early in the course of peripheral artery disease. If you smoke, quitting is the single most important thing you can do to reduce your risk of complications. Walking or doing other exercise on a regular basis following a schedule, referred to as supervised exercise training, can improve your symptoms dramatically.\nIf you have signs or symptoms of peripheral artery disease, you likely will need additional medical treatment. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to prevent blood clots, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and control pain and other symptoms.\n        \n            \n            Medications\n    \n    Cholesterol-lowering medications. You may take a cholesterol-lowering drug called a statin to reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke.\n    The goal for people who have peripheral artery disease is to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the \"bad\" cholesterol, to less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 2.6 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). The goal is even lower if you have additional major risk factors for heart attack and stroke, especially diabetes or continued smoking.\n    \n    \n    High blood pressure medications. If you also have high blood pressure, your doctor may prescribe medications to lower it.\n    Your blood pressure treatment goal should be less than 130/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). This is the guideline for anyone with coronary artery disease, diabetes or chronic kidney disease. Achieving 130/80 mm Hg is also the goal for healthy adults age 65 and older and healthy adults younger than age 65 with a 10% or higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years.\n    \n    Medication to control blood sugar. If you have diabetes, controlling your blood sugar levels becomes even more important. Talk with your doctor about your blood sugar goals and the steps you need to take to achieve these goals.\n    \n    Medications to prevent blood clots. Because peripheral artery disease is related to reduced blood flow to your limbs, it's important to improve that flow.\n    Your doctor may prescribe daily aspirin therapy or another medication, such as clopidogrel (Plavix).\n    \n    \n    Symptom-relief medications. The drug cilostazol increases blood flow to the limbs both by keeping the blood thin and by widening the blood vessels. It specifically helps treat leg pain in people who have peripheral artery disease. Common side effects of this medication include headache and diarrhea.\n    An alternative to cilostazol is pentoxifylline (Pentoxil). Side effects are rare with this medication, but it's generally doesn't work as well as cilostazol.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Angioplasty and surgery\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Graft bypass\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGraft bypass\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGraft bypass\n\t\t\t\tA graft is used to redirect blood flow around a blocked or narrowed artery. A graft can be a blood vessel from another part of the body or a synthetic substitute.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, angioplasty or surgery may be necessary to treat peripheral artery disease that's causing claudication:\n\n    \n    Angioplasty. In this procedure, a catheter is threaded through a blood vessel to the affected artery. There, a small balloon on the tip of the catheter is inflated to flatten the plaque into the artery wall and reopen the artery while stretching the artery open to increase blood flow.\n    Your doctor may also insert a mesh tube (stent) in the artery to help keep it open. This is the same procedure doctors use to open heart arteries.\n    \n    Bypass surgery. Your doctor may create a path around the blocked artery using either a blood vessel from another part of your body or a synthetic vessel. This technique allows blood to bypass the blocked or narrowed artery.\n    Thrombolytic therapy. If you have a blood clot blocking an artery, your doctor may inject a clot-dissolving drug into your artery at the point of the clot to break it up.\n\n        \n            \n            Supervised exercise programYour doctor likely will prescribe a supervised exercise training program to increase the distance you can walk pain-free.

A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cell to start making new bone when it isn't needed. The result is a mass (tumor) of poorly formed bone cells that can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.

Tests can show whether the cells are cancerous. Lab tests can determine the type of cancer and whether it's aggressive (the grade).\nTypes of biopsy procedures used to diagnose osteosarcoma include:\n\n    Needle biopsy. The doctor inserts a thin needle through the skin and guides it into the tumor. The needle is used to remove small pieces of tissue from the tumor.\n    Surgical biopsy. The doctor makes an incision through the skin and removes either the entire tumor (excisional biopsy) or a portion of the tumor (incisional biopsy).\n\nDetermining the type of biopsy needed and the specifics of how it should be performed requires careful planning by the medical team. Doctors need to perform the biopsy in a way that won't interfere with future surgery to remove the cancer. For this reason, ask your doctor for a referral to a team of experts with extensive experience in treating osteosarcoma before the biopsy.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your osteosarcoma-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Osteosarcoma treatment typically involves surgery and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy might be an option in certain situations.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryThe goal of surgery is to remove all of the cancer cells. But planning the operation also takes into consideration how it will affect your ability to go about your daily life. The extent of surgery for osteosarcoma depends on several factors, such as the size of the tumor and its location.\nOperations used to treat osteosarcoma include:\n\n    \n    Surgery to remove the cancer only (limb-sparing surgery). Most osteosarcoma operations can be done in a way that removes all of the cancer and spares the limb so that function can be maintained. Whether this procedure is an option depends, in part, on the extent of the cancer and how much muscle and tissue need to be removed.\n    If a section of bone is removed, the surgeon will reconstruct the bone. The method of reconstruction depends on your particular situation, but options include metal prosthetics or bone grafts.\n    \n    Surgery to remove the affected limb (amputation). With advancements in limb-sparing surgery, the need for amputation \u2014 removing a limb or part of a limb \u2014 has greatly reduced over the years. If amputation is necessary, advances in prosthetic joints can significantly improve outcomes and function.\n    Surgery to remove the lower portion of the leg (rotationplasty). In this surgery, sometimes used for children who are still growing, the surgeon removes the cancer and surrounding area, including the knee joint. The foot and ankle are then rotated, and the ankle functions as a knee. A prosthesis is used for the lower leg and foot. Results typically enable the person to function very well in physical activities, sports and daily living.\n\n        \n            \n            ChemotherapyChemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy treatment usually combines two or more drugs that can be administered as an infusion into a vein (IV), in pill form, or through both methods.\nFor osteosarcoma, chemotherapy is often recommended before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy). Doctors monitor how the cancer cells respond to the chemotherapy in order to plan further treatments.\nIf the osteosarcoma shrinks in response to the chemotherapy, it may make limb-sparing surgery possible.\nIf the osteosarcoma doesn't respond to treatment, it may indicate the cancer is very aggressive. Doctors may recommend a different combination of chemotherapy drugs or suggest a more aggressive operation to ensure all the cancer is removed.\nChemotherapy can also be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain.\nIf osteosarcoma returns after surgery or spreads to other areas of the body, chemotherapy might be recommended to try to slow the growth of the disease.\n        \n            \n            Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. Radiation might be an option in certain situations, such as when surgery isn't possible or if surgeons can't remove all of the cancer during an operation.\nDuring radiation therapy, the beams of energy are delivered from a machine that moves around you as you lie on a table. The beams are carefully directed to the area of the osteosarcoma in order to reduce the risk of damage to surrounding healthy cells.\n        \n            \n            "},

Straps are put around your body to hold you in place. After lying flat for a while, the table is tilted to raise your body and head \u2014 simulating a change in position from lying down to standing up. During this test, your heart rate and blood pressure are monitored to evaluate your body's cardiovascular response to the change in position.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nYour doctor's goal in evaluating orthostatic hypotension is to find the cause and determine appropriate treatment. The cause isn't always known.\nYour doctor may review your medical history and your symptoms and conduct a physical examination to help diagnose your condition.\nYour doctor also may recommend one or more of the following:\n\n    Blood pressure monitoring. Your doctor will measure your blood pressure both while you're sitting and while you're standing and will compare the measurements. Your doctor will diagnose orthostatic hypotension if you have a drop of 20 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) in your systolic blood pressure or a drop of 10 mm Hg in your diastolic blood pressure within two to five minutes of standing, or if standing causes signs and symptoms.\n    Blood tests. These can provide information about your overall health, including low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or low red blood cell levels (anemia), both of which can cause low blood pressure.\n    \n    Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This noninvasive test detects irregularities in your heart rhythm or heart structure and problems with the supply of blood and oxygen to your heart muscle.\n    During this test, soft, sticky patches (electrodes) are attached to the skin of your chest, arms and legs. The patches detect your heart's electrical signals while a machine records them on graph paper or displays them on a screen.\n    Sometimes, heart rhythm abnormalities come and go, and an ECG won't find problems. If this happens, you may be asked to wear a 24-hour Holter monitor to record your heart's electrical activity as you go about your daily routine. \n    \n    \n    Echocardiogram. In this noninvasive exam, sound waves are used to produce a video image of your heart. Sound waves are directed at your heart from a wandlike device (transducer) that's held on your chest.\n    The sound waves that bounce off your heart are reflected through your chest wall and processed electronically to provide video images of your heart in motion to detect structural heart disease.\n    \n    Stress test. A stress test is performed while you're exercising, such as walking on a treadmill. Or you may be given medication to make your heart work harder if you're unable to exercise. Your heart is then monitored with electrocardiography, echocardiography or other tests.\n    Tilt table test. A tilt table test evaluates how your body reacts to changes in position. You'll lie on a flat table that tilts to raise the upper part of your body, which simulates the movement from lying down to standing. Your blood pressure is taken frequently as the table is tilted.\n    Valsalva maneuver.

That usually involves increasing blood volume, reducing the pooling of blood in your lower legs and helping blood vessels to push blood throughout your body.\nTreatment often addresses the cause \u2014 dehydration or heart failure, for example \u2014 rather than the low blood pressure itself.\nFor mild orthostatic hypotension, one of the simplest treatments is to sit or lie back down immediately after feeling lightheaded upon standing. Your symptoms should disappear.\nWhen low blood pressure is caused by medications, treatment usually involves changing the dose of the medication or stopping it.\nOrthostatic hypotension treatments include:\n\n    \n    Lifestyle changes. Your doctor may suggest several lifestyle changes, including drinking enough water; drinking little to no alcohol; avoiding overheating; elevating the head of your bed; avoiding crossing your legs when sitting; and standing up slowly. Then pause briefly to be sure it's ok for you to start walking.\n    \n    If you don't also have high blood pressure, your doctor might suggest increasing the amount of salt in your diet. If your blood pressure drops after eating, your doctor may recommend small, low-carbohydrate meals.\n    Compression stockings. Compression stockings and garments or abdominal binders may help reduce the pooling of blood in your legs and reduce the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.\n    \n    Medications. A few drugs are used to treat orthostatic hypotension, including midodrine (Orvaten) and droxidopa (Northera). Side effects of midodrine can include retaining urine, tingling or itchy scalp, and goose-bumps. Side effects of droxidopa can include nausea, headache and bladder pain. With either drug, avoid lying flat for four hours after taking it to reduce the risk of high blood pressure while lying down.\n    Fludrocortisone is often used to help increase the amount of fluid in your blood, which raises blood pressure, but it can have serious side effects. If you take fludrocortisone, your doctor will monitor you for side effects.\n    Another medication is pyridostigmine (Mestinon, Regonol). This drug might be more effective combined with midodrine.

It's believed to develop when the immune system mistakenly targets the substance covering your optic nerve, resulting in inflammation and damage to the myelin.\nNormally, the myelin helps electrical impulses travel quickly from the eye to the brain, where they're converted into visual information. Optic neuritis disrupts this process, affecting vision.\nThe following autoimmune conditions often are associated with optic neuritis:\n\n    \n    Multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which your autoimmune system attacks the myelin sheath covering nerve fibers in your brain. In people with optic neuritis, the risk of developing multiple sclerosis after one episode of optic neuritis is about 50% over a lifetime.\n    Your risk of developing multiple sclerosis after optic neuritis increases further if an MRI scan shows lesions on your brain.\n    \n    Neuromyelitis optica. In this condition, inflammation affects the optic nerve and spinal cord. Neuromyelitis optica has similarities to multiple sclerosis, but neuromyelitis optica doesn't cause damage to the nerves in the brain as often as multiple sclerosis does. Still, neuromyelitis optica is more severe than MS, often resulting in a diminished recovery after an attack compared with MS.\nMyelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody disorder. This condition can cause inflammation to the optic nerve, spinal cord or brain. Similar to MS and neuromyelitis optica, recurrent attacks of inflammation can occur. Recovery from MOG attacks is usually better than recovery from neuromyelitis optica.\n\nWhen symptoms of optic neuritis are more complex, other associated causes need to be considered, including:\n\n    Infections. Bacterial infections, including Lyme disease, cat-scratch fever and syphilis, or viruses, such as measles, mumps and herpes, can cause optic neuritis.\n    Other diseases. Diseases such as sarcoidosis, Behcet's disease and lupus can cause recurrent optic neuritis.\n    Drugs and toxins. Some drugs and toxins have been associated with the development of optic neuritis. Ethambutol, used to treat tuberculosis, and methanol, a common ingredient in antifreeze, paints and solvents, are associated with optic neuritis.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "You're likely to see an ophthalmologist for a diagnosis, which is generally based on your medical history and an exam. The ophthalmologist likely will perform the following eye tests:\n\n    A routine eye exam. Your eye doctor will check your vision and your ability to perceive colors and measure your side (peripheral) vision.\n    Ophthalmoscopy. During this examination, your doctor shines a bright light into your eye and examines the structures at the back of your eye. This eye test evaluates the optic disk, where the optic nerve enters the retina in your eye. The optic disk becomes swollen in about one-third of people with optic neuritis.\n    Pupillary light reaction test. Your doctor may move a flashlight in front of your eyes to see how your pupils respond when they're exposed to bright light. If you have optic neuritis, your pupils won't constrict as much as pupils in healthy eyes would when exposed to light.\n\nOther tests to diagnose optic neuritis might include:\n\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI scan uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of your body. During an MRI to check for optic neuritis, you might receive an injection of a contrast solution to make the optic nerve and other parts of your brain more visible on the images.\n    An MRI is important to determine whether there are damaged areas (lesions) in your brain. Such lesions indicate a high risk of developing multiple sclerosis. An MRI can also rule out other causes of visual loss, such as a tumor.\n    \n    Blood tests. A blood test is available to check for infections or specific antibodies. Neuromyelitis optica is linked to an antibody that causes severe optic neuritis. People with severe optic neuritis may undergo this test to determine whether they're likely to develop neuromyelitis optica. For atypical cases of optic neuritis, blood may also be tested for MOG antibodies.\n    Optical coherence tomography (OCT). This test measures the thickness of the eye's retinal nerve fiber layer, which is often thinner from optic neuritis.\n    Visual field test. This test measures the peripheral vision of each eye to determine if there is any vision loss. Optic neuritis can cause any pattern of visual field loss.\n    Visual evoked response. During this test, you sit before a screen on which an alternating checkerboard pattern is displayed. Attached to your head are wires with small patches to record your brain's responses to what you see on the screen. This type of test tells your doctor if the electrical signals to your brain are slower than normal as a result of optic nerve damage.\n\nYour doctor is likely to ask you to return for follow-up exams two to four weeks after your symptoms begin to confirm the diagnosis of optic neuritis.More InformationEye examMRISed rate (erythrocyte sedimentation rate)\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Optic neuritis usually improves on its own. In some cases, steroid medications are used to reduce inflammation in the optic nerve. Possible side effects from steroid treatment include weight gain, mood changes, facial flushing, stomach upset and insomnia.\nSteroid treatment is usually given by vein (intravenously). Intravenous steroid therapy quickens vision recovery, but it doesn't appear to affect the amount of vision you'll recover for typical optic neuritis.\nWhen steroid therapy fails and severe vision loss persists, a treatment called plasma exchange therapy might help some people recover their vision.

Because ODD often occurs along with other behavioral or mental health problems, symptoms of ODD may be difficult to distinguish from those related to other problems.\nYour child's evaluation will likely include an assessment of:\n\n    Overall health\n    Frequency and intensity of behaviors\n    Emotions and behavior across multiple settings and relationships\n    Family situations and interactions\n    Strategies that have been helpful \u2014 or not helpful \u2014 in managing problem behaviors\n    Presence of other mental health, learning or communication disorders\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for oppositional defiant disorder primarily involves family-based interventions, but it may include other types of psychotherapy and training for your child \u2014 as well as for parents. Treatment often lasts several months or longer. It's important to treat any co-occurring problems, such as a learning disorder, because they can create or worsen ODD symptoms if left untreated.\nMedications alone generally aren't used for ODD unless your child also has another mental health disorder. If your child has coexisting disorders, such as ADHD, anxiety or depression, medications may help improve these symptoms.\nThe cornerstones of treatment for ODD usually include:\n\n    Parent training. A mental health professional with experience treating ODD may help you develop parenting skills that are more consistent, positive and less frustrating for you and your child. In some cases, your child may participate in this training with you, so everyone in your family develops shared goals for how to handle problems. Involving other authority figures, such as teachers, in the training may be an important part of treatment.\n    Parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT). During PCIT, a therapist coaches parents while they interact with their child. In one approach, the therapist sits behind a one-way mirror and, using an \"ear bug\" audio device, guides parents through strategies that reinforce their child's positive behavior. As a result, parents learn more-effective parenting techniques, the quality of the parent-child relationship improves, and problem behaviors decrease.\n    Individual and family therapy. Individual therapy for your child may help him or her learn to manage anger and express feelings in a healthier way. Family therapy may help improve your communication and relationships and help members of your family learn how to work together.\n    Cognitive problem-solving training. This type of therapy is aimed at helping your child identify and change thought patterns that lead to behavior problems. Collaborative problem-solving \u2014 in which you and your child work together to come up with solutions that work for both of you \u2014 can help improve ODD-related problems.\n    Social skills training. Your child may also benefit from therapy that will help him or her be more flexible and learn how to interact more positively and effectively with peers.\n\nAs part of parent training, you may learn how to manage your child's behavior by:\n\n    Giving clear instructions and following through with appropriate consequences when needed\n    Recognizing and praising your child's good behaviors and positive characteristics to promote desired behaviors\n\nAlthough some parenting techniques may seem like common sense, learning to use them consistently in the face of opposition isn't easy, especially if there are other stressors at home. Learning these skills will require routine practice and patience.\nMost important in treatment is for you to show consistent, unconditional love and acceptance of your child \u2014 even during difficult and disruptive situations. Don't be too hard on yourself. This process can be tough for even the most patient parents.More InformationFamily therapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

{"Diseases": "DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome)", "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) can vary in type and severity, depending on what body systems are affected and how severe the defects are. Some signs and symptoms may be apparent at birth, but others may not appear until later in infancy or early childhood.\nSigns and symptoms may include some combination of the following:\n\n    Heart murmur and bluish skin due to poor circulation of oxygen-rich blood (cyanosis) as a result of a heart defect\n    Frequent infections\n    Certain facial features, such as an underdeveloped chin, low-set ears, wide-set eyes or a narrow groove in the upper lip\n    A gap in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) or other problems with the palate\n    Delayed growth\n    Difficulty feeding, failure to gain weight or gastrointestinal problems\n    Breathing problems\n    Poor muscle tone\n    Delayed development, such as delays in rolling over, sitting up or other infant milestones\n    Delayed speech development or nasal-sounding speech\n    Learning delays or disabilities\n    Behavior problems\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nOther conditions may cause signs and symptoms similar to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. So it's important to get an accurate and prompt diagnosis if your child shows any signs or symptoms listed above.\nDoctors may suspect 22q11.2 deletion syndrome:\n\n\n    At birth. If certain conditions \u2014 a severe heart defect, cleft palate or a combination of other factors typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome \u2014 are readily apparent at birth, diagnostic tests will likely begin before your child leaves the hospital.\n    At well-baby visits. Your family doctor or pediatrician may suspect the disorder because of a combination of illnesses or disorders that become apparent over time. Other issues may come to the attention of your doctor during regularly scheduled well-baby visits or annual checkups for your child.\n\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Each person has two copies of chromosome 22, one inherited from each parent.

The region of chromosome 22 that's deleted is known as 22q11.2.\nThe deletion of genes from chromosome 22 usually occurs as a random event in the father's sperm or in the mother's egg, or it may occur early during fetal development. Rarely, the deletion is an inherited condition passed to a child from a parent who also has deletions in chromosome 22 but may or may not have symptoms.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "A diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) is based primarily on a lab test that can detect the deletion in chromosome 22. Your doctor will likely order this test if your child has:\n\n    A combination of medical problems or conditions suggesting 22q11.2 deletion syndrome\n    A heart defect, because certain heart defects are commonly associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome\n\nIn some cases, a child may have a combination of conditions that suggest 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, but the lab test doesn't indicate a deletion in chromosome 22. Although these cases present a diagnostic challenge, the coordination of care to address all of the medical, developmental or behavioral problems will likely be similar.More InformationGenetic testing\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Although there is no cure for DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome), treatments can usually correct critical problems, such as a heart defect or cleft palate. Other health issues and developmental, mental health or behavioral problems can be addressed or monitored as needed.\nTreatments and therapy for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may include interventions for:\n\n    Hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism can usually be managed with calcium supplements and vitamin D supplements.\n    Heart defects. Most heart defects associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome require surgery soon after birth to repair the heart and improve the supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n    Limited thymus gland function.

In this case it's called paroxysmal (par-ok-SIZ-mul) atrial fibrillation. You may have symptoms that come and go, usually lasting for a few minutes to hours. Sometimes symptoms occur for as long as a week and episodes can happen repeatedly. Your symptoms might go away on their own or you may need treatment.\n    Persistent. With this type of atrial fibrillation, your heart rhythm doesn't go back to normal on its own.

In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from multiple locations in the upper chambers \u2014 most often from the pulmonary veins. The atrioventricular (AV) node doesn't stop the extra signals from entering the ventricles. The result is a rapid and chaotic heartbeat.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAtrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that occurs when the two upper chambers of your heart experience chaotic electrical signals. The result is a fast and irregular heart rhythm. The heart rate in atrial fibrillation may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute. The normal range for a heart rate is 60 to 100 beats a minute.\nYour heart is made up of four chambers \u2014 two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Within the upper right chamber of your heart (right atrium) is a group of cells called the sinus node. This is your heart's natural pacemaker. The sinus node produces the signal that normally starts each heartbeat.\nNormally, the signal travels through the two upper heart chambers, and then through a connecting pathway between the upper and lower chambers called the atrioventricular (AV) node. The movement of the signal causes your heart to squeeze (contract), sending blood to your heart and body.\nIn atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of your heart are chaotic. As a result, they quiver. The AV node \u2014 the electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles \u2014 is bombarded with impulses trying to get through to the ventricles.\nThe ventricles also beat rapidly, but not as rapidly as the atria, as not all the impulses get through.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Possible causes of atrial fibrillationAbnormalities or damage to the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation. Possible causes of atrial fibrillation include:\n\n    High blood pressure\n    Heart attack\n    Coronary artery disease\n    Abnormal heart valves\n    Heart defects you're born with (congenital)\n    An overactive thyroid gland or other metabolic imbalance\n    Exposure to stimulants, such as medications, caffeine, tobacco or alcohol\n    Sick sinus syndrome \u2014 improper functioning of the heart's natural pacemaker\n    Lung diseases\n    Previous heart surgery\n    Viral infections\n    Stress due to surgery, pneumonia or other illnesses\n    Sleep apnea\n\nHowever, some people who have atrial fibrillation don't have any heart defects or damage, a condition called lone atrial fibrillation. In lone atrial fibrillation, the cause is often unclear, and serious complications are rare.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Atrial flutterAtrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, but the rhythm in your atria is more organized and less chaotic than the abnormal patterns common with atrial fibrillation. Sometimes you may have atrial flutter that develops into atrial fibrillation and vice versa.\nThe risk factors for and the symptoms and causes of atrial flutter are similar to those of atrial fibrillation. For example, strokes are also a concern in someone with atrial flutter. As with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter is usually not life-threatening when it's properly treated.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To diagnose atrial fibrillation, your doctor may review your signs and symptoms, review your medical history, and conduct a physical examination. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition, including:\n\n    Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG uses small sensors (electrodes) attached to your chest and arms to sense and record electrical signals as they travel through your heart. This test is a primary tool for diagnosing atrial fibrillation.\n    Holter monitor. This portable ECG device is carried in your pocket or worn on a belt or shoulder strap. It records your heart's activity for 24 hours or longer, which provides your doctor with a prolonged look at your heart rhythms.\n    Event recorder. This portable ECG device is intended to monitor your heart activity over a few weeks to a few months. When you experience symptoms of a fast heart rate, you push a button, and an ECG strip of the preceding few minutes and following few minutes is recorded. This permits your doctor to determine your heart rhythm at the time of your symptoms.\n    Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. Usually, a wandlike device (transducer) is held on your chest. Sometimes, a flexible tube with the transducer is guided down your throat through to your esophagus. Your doctor may use an echocardiogram to diagnose structural heart disease or blood clots in the heart.\n    Blood tests. These help your doctor rule out thyroid problems or other substances in your blood that may lead to atrial fibrillation.\n    Stress test. Also called exercise testing, stress testing involves running tests on your heart while you're exercising.\n    Chest X-ray. X-ray images help your doctor see the condition of your lungs and heart.

Generally, the treatment goals for atrial fibrillation are to:\n\n    Reset the rhythm or control the rate\n    Prevent blood clots, which may decrease the risk of a stroke\n\nThe strategy you and your doctor choose depends on many factors, including whether you have other problems with your heart and if you're able to take medications that can control your heart rhythm. In some cases, you may need a more invasive treatment, such as medical procedures using catheters or surgery.\nIn some people, a specific event or an underlying condition, such as a thyroid disorder, may trigger atrial fibrillation. Treating the condition causing atrial fibrillation may help relieve your heart rhythm problems. If your symptoms are bothersome or if this is your first episode of atrial fibrillation, your doctor may attempt to reset the rhythm.\n        \n            \n            Resetting your heart's rhythmIdeally, to treat atrial fibrillation, the heart rate and rhythm are reset to normal. To correct your condition, doctors may be able to reset your heart to its regular rhythm (sinus rhythm) using a procedure called cardioversion, depending on the underlying cause of atrial fibrillation and how long you've had it.\nCardioversion can be done in two ways:\n\n    \n    Electrical cardioversion. In this brief procedure, an electrical shock is delivered to your heart through paddles or patches placed on your chest. The shock stops your heart's electrical activity for a short moment. The goal is to reset your heart's normal rhythm.\n    You will be given a sedative before the procedure, so you shouldn't feel the electric shock. You may also receive medications to help restore a normal heartbeat (anti-arrhythmics) before the procedure.\n    \n    \n    Cardioversion with drugs. This form of cardioversion uses medications called anti-arrhythmics to help restore normal sinus rhythm. Depending on your heart condition, you may receive medications through an IV or by mouth to help return your heart to normal rhythm.\n    This is often done in the hospital with continuous monitoring of your heart rate. If your heart rhythm returns to normal, your doctor often will prescribe the same anti-arrhythmic medication or a similar one to try to prevent more spells of atrial fibrillation.\n    \n\nBefore cardioversion, you may be given warfarin or another blood-thinning medication for several weeks to reduce the risk of blood clots and strokes. If your episode of atrial fibrillation lasted more than 48 hours, you may need to take this type of medication for at least a month after the procedure to prevent blood clots in the heart.\n        \n            \n            Maintaining a normal heart rhythmAfter electrical cardioversion, your doctor may prescribe anti-arrhythmic medications to help prevent future episodes of atrial fibrillation. Medications may include:\n\n    Dofetilide\n    Flecainide\n    Propafenone\n    Amiodarone\n    Sotalol\n\nAlthough these drugs may help maintain a normal heart rhythm, they can cause side effects, including:\n\n    Nausea\n    Dizziness\n    Fatigue\n\nRarely, they may cause ventricular arrhythmias \u2014 life-threatening rhythm disturbances originating in the heart's lower chambers. These medications may be needed indefinitely. Even with medications, there is a chance of another episode of atrial fibrillation.\n        \n            \n            Heart rate controlYou may be prescribed medications to control how fast your heart beats and restore it to a normal rate.\n\n    Digoxin. This medication may control the heart rate at rest, but not as well during activity. Most people need additional or alternative medications, such as calcium channel blockers or beta blockers.\n    Beta blockers. These medications can help to slow the heart rate at rest and during activity. They may cause side effects such as low blood pressure (hypotension).\n    Calcium channel blockers. These medicines also can control your heart rate, but may need to be avoided if you have heart failure or low blood pressure.\n\n        \n            \n            Catheter and surgical procedures\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Catheter ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins to treat atrial fibrillation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCatheter ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins to treat atrial fibrillation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCatheter ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins to treat atrial fibrillation\n\t\t\t\tAtrial fibrillation is often caused by rapidly discharging triggers, or \"hot spots.\" In catheter ablation to treat atrial fibrillation, a doctor inserts long, thin tubes (catheters) into your groin and guides them through blood vessels to your heart. The electrodes at the tips of the catheters help your doctor determine where these triggers are located. Electrodes at the catheter tips can use radiofrequency energy, extreme cold (cryotherapy) or heat to destroy these triggers, scarring the tissue so that the erratic signals are normalized.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    AV node ablation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAV node ablation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAV node ablation\n\t\t\t\tIn atrioventricular (AV) node ablation, doctors use heat (radiofrequency) energy to destroy the electrical connection between the upper and lower heart chambers (AV node), blocking the heart's electrical signals. Once the AV node is destroyed, doctors then implant a small medical device to maintain your heart rhythm (pacemaker).\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nSometimes medications or cardioversion to control atrial fibrillation doesn't work. In those cases, your doctor may recommend a procedure to destroy the area of heart tissue that's causing the erratic electrical signals and restore your heart to a normal rhythm. These options can include:\n\n    \n    Catheter ablation. During this procedure, a doctor inserts long, thin tubes (catheters) into your groin and guides them through blood vessels to your heart. The catheter's tip produces radiofrequency energy, extreme cold (cryotherapy) or heat to destroy areas of heart tissue that are causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Scar tissue forms, which helps signaling return to normal. Cardiac ablation may correct the arrhythmia without the need for medications or implantable devices.\n    Your doctor may recommend this procedure if you have atrial fibrillation and an otherwise normal heart and medication has not improved your symptoms. It may also be helpful for heart failure patients who have an implanted device and cannot take or tolerate anti-arrhythmic medications.\n    \n    \n    Maze procedure. There are several variations of the maze procedure. The doctor may use a scalpel, radiofrequency or extreme cold (cryotherapy) to create a pattern of scar tissue that interferes with stray electrical impulses that cause atrial fibrillation.\n    The maze procedures have a high success rate, but atrial fibrillation may come back. If this happens, you may need another cardiac ablation or other heart treatment.\n    Because the surgical maze procedure (using a scalpel) requires open-heart surgery, it's generally reserved for people who don't get better with other treatments or when it can be done during a necessary heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or heart valve repair.\n    \n    Atrioventricular (AV) node ablation. If medications or other forms of catheter ablation don't work or cause side effects, or if you're not a good candidate for these therapies, AV node ablation may be an option. The procedure involves using a catheter to deliver radiofrequency energy to the pathway (AV node) connecting the upper and lower heart chambers.\n    The procedure destroys a small area of heart tissue, preventing abnormal signaling. However, the upper chambers of the heart (atria) will still quiver. You'll need a pacemaker to be implanted to keep the lower chambers (ventricles) beating properly. You'll need to take blood thinners after this procedure to reduce the risk of a stroke due to atrial fibrillation.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Preventing blood clotsMany people with atrial fibrillation or those who are undergoing certain treatments for atrial fibrillation are at especially high risk of blood clots that can lead to a stroke. The risk is even higher if other heart disease is present along with atrial fibrillation.\nAnticoagulants\nYour doctor may prescribe blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) such as:\n\n    Warfarin. Warfarin may be prescribed to prevent blood clots. If you're prescribed warfarin, carefully follow your doctor's instructions. Warfarin is a powerful medication that may cause dangerous bleeding. You'll need to have regular blood tests to monitor warfarin's effects.\n    Newer anticoagulants. Several newer blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) are available to prevent strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. These medications include dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. They are shorter acting than warfarin and usually don't require regular blood tests or monitoring by your doctor. These medications aren't approved for people who have mechanical heart valves.\n\nMany people have spells of atrial fibrillation and don't even know it \u2014 so you may need lifelong anticoagulants even after your rhythm has been restored to normal.\nLeft atrial appendage closure\nYour doctor may also consider a procedure called left atrial appendage closure.\nIn this procedure, doctors insert a catheter through a vein in the leg and eventually guide it to the upper left heart chamber (left atrium). A device called a left atrial appendage closure device is then inserted through the catheter to close a small sac (appendage) in the left atrium.\nThis may reduce the risk of blood clots in certain people with atrial fibrillation, as many blood clots that occur in atrial fibrillation form in the left atrial appendage. Candidates for this procedure may include those who don't have heart valve problems, who have an increased risk of blood clots and bleeding, and who are aren't able to take anticoagulants. Your doctor will evaluate you and determine if you're a candidate for the procedure.More InformationAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAtrial fibrillation ablationAV node ablationCardiac ablationMaze procedureMinimally invasive heart surgeryPulmonary vein isolationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillationShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

from nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The brain's nerve cells normally send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them.\nIn people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern.\nPeople who have seizures may also have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another (neurotransmitters).\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    EEG brain activity\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tEEG brain activity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEEG brain activity\n\t\t\t\tAn EEG records the electrical activity of your brain via electrodes affixed to your scalp. EEG results show changes in brain activity that may be useful in diagnosing brain conditions, especially epilepsy and other seizure disorders.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nYour doctor will ask for a detailed description of the seizures and conduct a physical exam. Tests may include:\n\n    \n    Electroencephalography (EEG). This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small electrodes attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap.\n    Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the normal pattern.\n    \n    Brain scans. In absence seizures, brain-imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will be normal. But tests such as MRI can produce detailed images of the brain, which can help rule out other problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Because your child will need to hold still for long periods, talk with your doctor about the possible use of sedation.\nMore InformationEEG (electroencephalogram)MRI\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Your doctor likely will start at the lowest dose of anti-seizure medication possible and increase the dosage as needed to control the seizures. Children may be able to taper off anti-seizure medications, under a doctor's supervision, after they've been seizure-free for two years.\nDrugs prescribed for absence seizure include:\n\n    Ethosuximide (Zarontin). This is the drug most doctors start with for absence seizures. In most cases, seizures respond well to this drug. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, trouble sleeping, hyperactivity.\n    \n    Valproic acid (Depakene). Girls who continue to need medication into adulthood should discuss potential risks of valproic acid with their doctors. Valproic acid has been associated with higher risk of birth defects in babies, and doctors advise women against using it during pregnancy or while trying to conceive.\n    Doctors may recommend the use of valproic acid in children who have both absence and grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures.\n    \n    Lamotrigine (Lamictal). Some studies show this drug to be less effective than ethosuximide or valproic acid, but it has fewer side effects. Side effects may include rash and nausea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t@font-face {\n\t\t\tfont-family: mayo-form-icons;\n\t\t\tsrc:

If the cyst becomes infected, you may experience:\n\n    A tender, painful lump near the vaginal opening\n    Discomfort while walking or sitting\n    Pain during intercourse\n    Fever\n\nA Bartholin's cyst or abscess typically occurs on only one side of the vaginal opening.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorCall your doctor if you have a painful lump near the opening of your vagina that doesn't improve after two or three days of self-care \u2014 for instance, soaking the area in warm water (sitz bath). If the pain is severe, make an appointment with your doctor right away.\nAlso call your doctor promptly if you find a new lump near your vaginal opening and you're older than 40.

Fluid may accumulate when the opening of the gland (duct) becomes obstructed, perhaps caused by infection or injury.\nA Bartholin's cyst can become infected, forming an abscess. A number of bacteria may cause the infection, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bacteria that cause sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To diagnose a Bartholin's cyst, your doctor may:\n\n    Ask questions about your medical history\n    Perform a pelvic exam\n    Take a sample of secretions from your vagina or cervix to test for a sexually transmitted infection\n    Recommend a test of the mass (biopsy) to check for cancerous cells if you're postmenopausal or over 40\n\nIf cancer is a concern, your doctor may refer you to a gynecologist who specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system.More InformationNeedle biopsyPelvic exam\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Often a Bartholin's cyst requires no treatment \u2014 especially if the cyst causes no signs or symptoms. When needed, treatment depends on the size of the cyst, your discomfort level and whether it's infected, which can result in an abscess.\nTreatment options your doctor may recommend include:\n\n    Sitz baths. Soaking in a tub filled with a few inches of warm water (sitz bath) several times a day for three or four days may help a small, infected cyst to rupture and drain on its own.\n    \n    Surgical drainage. You may need surgery to drain a cyst that's infected or very large. Drainage of a cyst can be done using local anesthesia or sedation.\n    For the procedure, your doctor makes a small incision in the cyst, allows it to drain, and then places a small rubber tube (catheter) in the incision. The catheter stays in place for up to six weeks to keep the incision open and allow complete drainage.\n    \n    Antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if your cyst is infected or if testing reveals that you have a sexually transmitted infection. But if the abscess is drained properly, you may not need antibiotics.\n    Marsupialization. If cysts recur or bother you, a marsupialization (mahr-soo-pee-ul-ih-ZAY-shun) procedure may help. Your doctor places stitches on each side of a drainage incision to create a permanent opening less than 1/4-inch (about 6-millimeter) long. An inserted catheter may be placed to promote drainage for a few days after the procedure and to help prevent recurrence.\n\nRarely, for persistent cysts that aren't effectively treated by the above procedures, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the Bartholin's gland. Surgical removal is usually done in a hospital under general anesthesia. Surgical removal of the gland carries a greater risk of bleeding or complications after the procedure.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},
{"Diseases": "Hyperhidrosis", "Symptoms": "Most people sweat when they exercise or exert themselves, are in a hot environment, or are anxious or under stress.

Eccrine glands occur over most of your body and open directly onto the surface of your skin. Apocrine glands open into the hair follicle, leading to the surface of the skin. Apocrine glands develop in areas abundant in hair follicles, such as on your scalp, armpits and groin.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweating is your body's mechanism to cool itself. Your nervous system automatically triggers your sweat glands when your body temperature rises. Sweating also normally occurs, especially on your palms, when you're nervous.\nThe most common form of hyperhidrosis is called primary focal (essential) hyperhidrosis. With this type, the nerves responsible for signaling your sweat glands become overactive, even though they haven't been triggered by physical activity or a rise in temperature. With stress or nervousness, the problem becomes even worse. This type usually affects your palms and soles and sometimes your face.\nThere is no medical cause for this type of hyperhidrosis. It may have a hereditary component, because it sometimes runs in families.\nSecondary hyperhidrosis occurs when excess sweating is due to a medical condition. It's the less common type. It's more likely to cause sweating all over your body.

Your doctor may prescribe an antiperspirant with aluminum chloride (Drysol, Xerac Ac). This product can cause skin and eye irritation. It's usually applied to the affected skin before you go to bed. Then you wash the product off when you get up, taking care to not get any in your eyes. If your skin becomes irritated, hydrocortisone cream might help.\n    Prescription creams. A prescription cream that contains glycopyrrolate may help hyperhidrosis that affects the face and head.\n    Nerve-blocking medications. Some oral medications block the chemicals that permit certain nerves to communicate with each other. This can reduce sweating in some people. Possible side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision and bladder problems.\n    Antidepressants. Some medications used for depression can also decrease sweating. In addition, they may help decrease the anxiety that worsens the hyperhidrosis.\n    Botulinum toxin injections. Treatment with botulinum toxin (Botox, Myobloc, others) temporarily blocks the nerves that cause sweating. Your skin will be iced or anesthetized first. Each affected area of your body will need several injections. The effects last six to 12 months, and then the treatment needs to be repeated. This treatment can be painful, and some people experience temporary muscle weakness in the treated area.\n\n        \n            \n            Surgical and other proceduresOther hyperhidrosis treatments include:\n\n    Microwave therapy. With this therapy, a device that delivers microwave energy is used to destroy sweat glands. Treatments involve two 20- to 30-minute sessions, three months apart. Possible side effects are a change in skin sensation and some discomfort. This therapy may be expensive and not widely available.\n    Sweat gland removal. If excessive sweating occurs just in your armpits, removing the sweat glands there may help. A minimally invasive technique called suction curettage may be an option, too, if you aren't responding to other treatments.\n    Nerve surgery (sympathectomy). During this procedure, the surgeon cuts, burns or clamps the spinal nerves that control sweating in your hands. In some cases, this procedure triggers excessive sweating in other areas of your body (compensatory sweating). Surgery is generally not an option for isolated head and neck sweating.

To test for achalasia, your doctor is likely to recommend:\n\n    Esophageal manometry. This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in your esophagus when you swallow, the coordination and force exerted by the esophagus muscles, and how well your lower esophageal sphincter relaxes or opens during a swallow. This test is the most helpful when determining which type of motility problem you might have.\n    X-rays of your upper digestive system (esophagram). X-rays are taken after you drink a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of your digestive tract. The coating allows your doctor to see a silhouette of your esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. You may also be asked to swallow a barium pill that can help to show a blockage of the esophagus.\n    Upper endoscopy. Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and camera (endoscope) down your throat, to examine the inside of your esophagus and stomach. Endoscopy can be used to define a partial blockage of the esophagus if your symptoms or results of a barium study indicate that possibility. Endoscopy can also be used to collect a sample of tissue (biopsy) to be tested for complications of reflux such as Barrett's esophagus.\n\nRead more about esophageal manometry  and upper endoscopy.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your achalasia-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Achalasia treatment focuses on relaxing or stretching open the lower esophageal sphincter so that food and liquid can move more easily through your digestive tract.\nSpecific treatment depends on your age, health condition and the severity of the achalasia.\n        \n            \n            Nonsurgical treatmentNonsurgical options include:\n\n    Pneumatic dilation. A balloon is inserted by endoscopy into the center of the esophageal sphincter and inflated to enlarge the opening. This outpatient procedure may need to be repeated if the esophageal sphincter doesn't stay open. Nearly one-third of people treated with balloon dilation need repeat treatment within five years. This procedure requires sedation.\n    \n    Botox (botulinum toxin type A). This muscle relaxant can be injected directly into the esophageal sphincter with an endoscopic needle. The injections may need to be repeated, and repeat injections may make it more difficult to perform surgery later if needed.\n    Botox is generally recommended only for people who aren't good candidates for pneumatic dilation or surgery due to age or overall health. Botox injections typically do not last more than six months. A strong improvement from injection of Botox may help confirm a diagnosis of achalasia.\n    \n    Medication. Your doctor might suggest muscle relaxants such as nitroglycerin (Nitrostat) or nifedipine (Procardia) before eating. These medications have limited treatment effect and severe side effects. Medications are generally considered only if you're not a candidate for pneumatic dilation or surgery, and Botox hasn't helped. This type of therapy is rarely indicated.\n\n        \n            \n            SurgerySurgical options for treating achalasia include:\n\n    \n    Heller myotomy. The surgeon cuts the muscle at the lower end of the esophageal sphincter to allow food to pass more easily into the stomach. The procedure can be done noninvasively (laparoscopic Heller myotomy). Some people who have a Heller myotomy may later develop gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n    To avoid future problems with GERD, a procedure known as fundoplication might be performed at the same time as a Heller myotomy. In fundoplication, the surgeon wraps the top of your stomach around the lower esophagus to create an anti-reflux valve, preventing acid from coming back (GERD) into the esophagus. Fundoplication is usually done with a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure.\n    \n    \n    Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). In the POEM procedure, the surgeon uses an endoscope inserted through your mouth and down your throat to create an incision in the inside lining of your esophagus. Then, as in a Heller myotomy, the surgeon cuts the muscle at the lower end of the esophageal sphincter.\n    POEM may also be combined with or followed by later fundoplication to help prevent GERD.

A tiny camera on the end of the endoscope lets your doctor examine your esophagus, stomach and the beginning of your small intestine (duodenum).\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nYour doctor might be able to diagnose GERD based on a physical examination and history of your signs and symptoms.\nTo confirm a diagnosis of GERD, or to check for complications, your doctor might recommend:\n\n    Upper endoscopy. Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and camera (endoscope) down your throat, to examine the inside of your esophagus and stomach. Test results can often be normal when reflux is present, but an endoscopy may detect inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) or other complications. An endoscopy can also be used to collect a sample of tissue (biopsy) to be tested for complications such as Barrett's esophagus.\n    Ambulatory acid (pH) probe test. A monitor is placed in your esophagus to identify when, and for how long, stomach acid regurgitates there. The monitor connects to a small computer that you wear around your waist or with a strap over your shoulder. The monitor might be a thin, flexible tube (catheter) that's threaded through your nose into your esophagus, or a clip that's placed in your esophagus during an endoscopy and that gets passed into your stool after about two days.\n    Esophageal manometry. This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in your esophagus when you swallow. Esophageal manometry also measures the coordination and force exerted by the muscles of your esophagus.\n    X-ray of your upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after you drink a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of your digestive tract. The coating allows your doctor to see a silhouette of your esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. You may also be asked to swallow a barium pill that can help diagnose a narrowing of the esophagus that may interfere with swallowing.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) care at Mayo ClinicNeedle biopsyUpper endoscopyX-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    GERD surgery\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGERD surgery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGERD surgery\n\t\t\t\tLaparoscopic anti-reflux surgery for GERD may involve a procedure to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter, called Nissen fundoplication.

If you don't experience relief within a few weeks, your doctor might recommend prescription medication or surgery.\n        \n            \n            Over-the-counter medicationsThe options include:\n\n    Antacids that neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. But antacids alone won't heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by stomach acid. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney problems.\n    Medications to reduce acid production. These medications \u2014 known as H-2-receptor blockers \u2014 include cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC) and nizatidine (Axid AR). H-2-receptor blockers don't act as quickly as antacids, but they provide longer relief and may decrease acid production from the stomach for up to 12 hours. Stronger versions are available by prescription.\n    Medications that block acid production and heal the esophagus. These medications \u2014 known as proton pump inhibitors \u2014 are stronger acid blockers than H-2-receptor blockers and allow time for damaged esophageal tissue to heal. Over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24 HR) and omeprazole (Prilosec OTC, Zegerid OTC).\n\n        \n            \n            Prescription medicationsPrescription-strength treatments for GERD include:\n\n    Prescription-strength H-2-receptor blockers. These include prescription-strength famotidine (Pepcid) and nizatidine. These medications are generally well-tolerated but long-term use may be associated with a slight increase in risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency and bone fractures.\n    Prescription-strength proton pump inhibitors. These include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant). Although generally well-tolerated, these medications might cause diarrhea, headache, nausea and vitamin B-12 deficiency. Chronic use might increase the risk of hip fracture.\n    Medication to strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter. Baclofen may ease GERD by decreasing the frequency of relaxations of the lower esophageal sphincter. Side effects might include fatigue or nausea.\n\n        \n            \n            Surgery and other proceduresGERD can usually be controlled with medication. But if medications don't help or you wish to avoid long-term medication use, your doctor might recommend:\n\n    Fundoplication. The surgeon wraps the top of your stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter, to tighten the muscle and prevent reflux. Fundoplication is usually done with a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure. The wrapping of the top part of the stomach can be partial or complete.\n    LINX device. A ring of tiny magnetic beads is wrapped around the junction of the stomach and esophagus. The magnetic attraction between the beads is strong enough to keep the junction closed to refluxing acid, but weak enough to allow food to pass through. The LINX device can be implanted using minimally invasive surgery.\n    \n    Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF). This new procedure involves tightening the lower esophageal sphincter by creating a partial wrap around the lower esophagus using polypropylene fasteners. TIF is performed through the mouth with a device called an endoscope and requires no surgical incision. Its advantages include quick recovery time and high tolerance.\n    If you have a large hiatal hernia, TIF alone is not an option.

{"Diseases": "Achilles tendon rupture", "Symptoms": "Although it's possible to have no signs or symptoms with an Achilles tendon rupture, most people have:\n\nThe feeling of having been kicked in the calf\nPain, possibly severe, and swelling near the heel\nAn inability to bend the foot downward or \"push off\" the injured leg when walking\nAn inability to stand on the toes on the injured leg\nA popping or snapping sound when the injury occurs\n\nWhen to see your doctor\nSeek medical advice immediately if you hear a pop in your heel, especially if you can't walk properly afterward.\n\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Your Achilles tendon helps you point your foot downward, rise on your toes and push off your foot as you walk. You rely on it virtually every time you walk and move your foot.\n\nRupture usually occurs in the section of the tendon situated within 2 1/2 inches (about 6 centimeters) of the point where it attaches to the heel bone. This section might be prone to rupture because blood flow is poor, which also can impair its ability to heal.\n\nRuptures often are caused by a sudden increase in the stress on your Achilles tendon. Common examples include:\n\nIncreasing the intensity of sports participation, especially in sports that involve jumping\nFalling from a height\nStepping into a hole\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During the physical exam, your doctor will inspect your lower leg for tenderness and swelling. Your doctor might be able to feel a gap in your tendon if it has ruptured completely.\n\nThe doctor might ask you to kneel on a chair or lie on your stomach with your feet hanging over the end of the exam table. He or she might then squeeze your calf muscle to see if your foot will automatically flex. If it doesn't, you probably have ruptured your Achilles tendon.\n\nIf there's a question about the extent of your Achilles tendon injury \u2014 whether it's completely or only partially ruptured \u2014 your doctor might order an ultrasound or MRI scan. These painless procedures create images of the tissues of your body.\nMore InformationMRI\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for a ruptured Achilles tendon often depends on your age, activity level and the severity of your injury. In general, younger and more active people, particularly athletes, tend to choose surgery to repair a completely ruptured Achilles tendon, while older people are more likely to opt for nonsurgical treatment.\n\nRecent studies, however, have shown fairly equal effectiveness of both surgical and nonsurgical management.\n\n        \n            \n            Nonsurgical treatmentThis approach typically involves:\n\nResting the tendon by using crutches\nApplying ice to the area\nTaking over-the-counter pain relievers\nKeeping the ankle from moving for the first few weeks, usually with a walking boot with heel wedges or a cast, with the foot flexed down\n\nNonoperative treatment avoids the risks associated with surgery, such as infection.\n\nHowever, a nonsurgical approach might increase your chances of re-rupture and recovery can take longer, although recent studies indicate favorable outcomes in people treated nonsurgically if they start rehabilitation with weight bearing early.\n\n        \n            \n            SurgeryThe procedure generally involves making an incision in the back of your lower leg and stitching the torn tendon together. Depending on the condition of the torn tissue, the repair might be reinforced with other tendons.\n\nComplications can include infection and nerve damage. Minimally invasive procedures reduce infection rates over those of open procedures.\n\n        \n            \n            RehabilitationAfter either treatment, you'll have physical therapy exercises to strengthen your leg muscles and Achilles tendon. Most people return to their former level of activity within four to six months. It's important to continue strength and stability training after that because some problems can persist for up to a year.\n\nA type of rehabilitation known as functional rehabilitation also focuses on coordination of body parts and how you move. The purpose is to return you to your highest level of performance, as an athlete or in your everyday life.\n\nOne review study concluded that if you have access to functional rehabilitation, you might do just as well with nonsurgical treatment as with surgery. More study is needed.\n\nRehabilitation after either surgical or nonsurgical management is also trending toward moving earlier and progressing faster.

While X-rays can't visualize soft tissues such as tendons, they may help rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.\n    Ultrasound. This device uses sound waves to visualize soft tissues like tendons. Ultrasound can also produce real-time images of the Achilles tendon in motion, and color-Doppler ultrasound can evaluate blood flow around the tendon.\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Therapists often prescribe specific stretching and strengthening exercises to promote healing and strengthening of the Achilles tendon and its supporting structures.\n    A special type of strengthening called \"eccentric\" strengthening, involving a slow let down of a weight after raising it, has been found to be especially helpful for persistent Achilles problems.\n    \n    Orthotic devices. A shoe insert or wedge that slightly elevates your heel can relieve strain on the tendon and provide a cushion that lessens the amount of force exerted on your Achilles tendon.\n\nSurgery\nIf several months of more-conservative treatments don't work or if the tendon has torn, your doctor may suggest surgery to repair your Achilles tendon.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

The ACL, one of two ligaments that cross in the middle of the knee, connects your thighbone to your shinbone and helps stabilize your knee joint.\nACL injuries often happen during sports and fitness activities that can put stress on the knee:\n\n    Suddenly slowing down and changing direction (cutting)\n    Pivoting with your foot firmly planted\n    Landing awkwardly from a jump\n    Stopping suddenly\n    Receiving a direct blow to the knee or having a collision, such as a football tackle\n\nWhen the ligament is damaged, there is usually a partial or complete tear of the tissue. A mild injury may stretch the ligament but leave it intact.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During the physical exam, your doctor will check your knee for swelling and tenderness \u2014 comparing your injured knee to your uninjured knee. He or she may also move your knee into a variety of positions to assess range of motion and overall function of the joint.\nOften the diagnosis can be made on the basis of the physical exam alone, but you may need tests to rule out other causes and to determine the severity of the injury. These tests may include:\n\n    X-rays. X-rays may be needed to rule out a bone fracture. However, X-rays don't show soft tissues, such as ligaments and tendons.\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create images of both hard and soft tissues in your body. An MRI can show the extent of an ACL injury and signs of damage to other tissues in the knee, including the cartilage.\n    Ultrasound. Using sound waves to visualize internal structures, ultrasound may be used to check for injuries in the ligaments, tendons and muscles of the knee.\nMore InformationMRIUltrasoundX-ray\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Prompt first-aid care can reduce pain and swelling immediately after an injury to your knee. Follow the R.I.C.E. model of self-care at home:\n\n    Rest. General rest is necessary for healing and limits weight bearing on your knee.\n    Ice. When you're awake, try to ice your knee at least every two hours for 20 minutes at a time.\n    Compression. Wrap an elastic bandage or compression wrap around your knee.\n    Elevation. Lie down with your knee propped up on pillows.\n\n        \n            \n            RehabilitationMedical treatment for an ACL injury begins with several weeks of rehabilitative therapy. A physical therapist will teach you exercises that you will perform either with continued supervision or at home. You may also wear a brace to stabilize your knee and use crutches for a while to avoid putting weight on your knee.\nThe goal of rehabilitation is to reduce pain and swelling, restore your knee's full range of motion, and strengthen muscles. This course of physical therapy may successfully treat an ACL injury for individuals who are relatively inactive, engage in moderate exercise and recreational activities, or play sports that put less stress on the knees.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryYour doctor may recommend surgery if:\n\n    You're an athlete and want to continue in your sport, especially if the sport involves jumping, cutting or pivoting\n    More than one ligament or the fibrous cartilage in your knee also is injured\n    The injury is causing your knee to buckle during everyday activities\n\nDuring ACL reconstruction, the surgeon removes the damaged ligament and replaces it with a segment of tendon \u2014 tissue similar to a ligament that connects muscle to bone. This replacement tissue is called a graft.\nYour surgeon will use a piece of tendon from another part of your knee or a tendon from a deceased donor.\nAfter surgery you'll resume another course of rehabilitative therapy. Successful ACL reconstruction paired with rigorous rehabilitation can usually restore stability and function to your knee.\nThere's no set time frame for athletes to return to play. Recent research indicates that up to one-third of athletes sustain another tear in the same or opposite knee within two years. A longer recovery period may reduce the risk of re-injury.\nIn general, it takes as long as a year or more before athletes can safely return to play. Doctors and physical therapists will perform tests to gauge your knee's stability, strength, function and readiness to return to sports activities at various intervals during your rehabilitation. It's important to ensure that strength, stability and movement patterns are optimized before you return to an activity with a risk of ACL injury.More InformationACL reconstructionKnee braces for osteoarthritis\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Bacteria can trigger inflammation and infection resulting in more severe acne.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFour main factors cause acne:\n\n    Excess oil (sebum) production\n    Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells\n    Bacteria\n    Inflammation\n\nAcne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.\nThe follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air.\nPimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne.\nCertain things may trigger or worsen acne:\n\n    Hormonal changes. Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too.\n    Certain medications. Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium.\n    Diet. Studies indicate that consuming certain foods \u2014 including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips \u2014 may worsen acne. Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions.\n    Stress. Stress doesn't cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Acne mythsThese factors have little effect on acne:\n\n    Chocolate and greasy foods. Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne.\n    Hygiene. Acne isn't caused by dirty skin. In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse.\n    Cosmetics. Cosmetics don't necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. Nonoily cosmetics don't interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs.\nMore InformationAdult acne: Can natural hormone treatments help?\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "", "Treatment": "If you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for several weeks and they haven't helped, ask your doctor about prescription-strength medications. A dermatologist can help you:\n\n    Control your acne\n    Avoid scarring or other damage to your skin\n    Make scars less noticeable\n\nAcne medications work by reducing oil production and swelling or by treating bacterial infection. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely.\nThe treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are often used in combination. Treatment options for pregnant women are limited due to the risk of side effects.\nTalk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering. And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves.\n        \n            \n            Topical medicationsThe most common topical prescription medications for acne are:\n\n    \n    Retinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.\n    Topical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with skin of color. Adapalene may be tolerated best.\n    \n    Antibiotics. These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance. Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, others) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin). Topical antibiotics alone aren't recommended.\n    \n    Azelaic acid and salicylic acid. Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast. It has antibacterial properties. A 20% azelaic acid cream or gel seems to be as effective as many conventional acne treatments when used twice a day. Prescription azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) is an option during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne. Side effects include skin redness and minor skin irritation.\n    Salicylic acid may help prevent plugged hair follicles and is available as both wash-off and leave-on products. Studies showing its effectiveness are limited. Side effects include skin discoloration and minor skin irritation.\n    \n    Dapsone. Dapsone (Aczone) 5% gel twice daily is recommended for inflammatory acne, especially in women with acne. Side effects include redness and dryness.\n\nEvidence is not strong in support of using zinc, sulfur, nicotinamide, resorcinol, sulfacetamide sodium or aluminum chloride in topical treatments for acne.\n        \n            \n            Oral medications\n    \n    Antibiotics. For moderate to severe acne, you may need oral antibiotics to reduce bacteria. Usually the first choice for treating acne is a tetracycline (minocycline, doxycycline) or a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin). A macrolide might be an option for people who can't take tetracyclines, including pregnant women and children under 8 years old.\n    Oral antibiotics should be used for the shortest time possible to prevent antibiotic resistance. And they should be combined with other drugs, such as benzoyl peroxide, to reduce the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.\n    Severe side effects from the use of antibiotics to treat acne are uncommon. These drugs do increase your skin's sun sensitivity.\n    \n    \n    Combined oral contraceptives. Four combined oral contraceptives are approved by the FDA for acne therapy in women who also wish to use them for contraception. They are products that combine progestin and estrogen (Ortho Tri-Cyclen 21, Yaz, others). You may not see the benefit of this treatment for a few months, so using other acne medications with it for the first few weeks may help.\n    Common side effects of combined oral contraceptives are weight gain, breast tenderness and nausea. These drugs are also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular problems, breast cancer and cervical cancer.\n    \n    Anti-androgen agents. The drug spironolactone (Aldactone) may be considered for women and adolescent girls if oral antibiotics aren't helping. It works by blocking the effect of androgen hormones on the oil-producing glands. Possible side effects include breast tenderness and painful periods.\n    \n    Isotretinoin. Isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, others) is a derivative of vitamin A. It may be prescribed for people whose moderate or severe acne hasn't responded to other treatments.\n    Potential side effects of oral isotretinoin include inflammatory bowel disease, depression and severe birth defects. All people receiving isotretinoin must participate in an FDA-approved risk management program. And they'll need to see their doctors regularly to monitor for side effects.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            TherapiesFor some people, the following therapies might be helpful, either alone or in combination with medications.\n\n    Light therapy. A variety of light-based therapies have been tried with some success. Most will require multiple visits to your doctor's office. Further study is needed to determine the ideal method, light source and dose.\n    Chemical peel. This procedure uses repeated applications of a chemical solution, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid or retinoic acid. This treatment is for mild acne. It might improve the appearance of the skin, though the change is not long lasting and repeat treatments are usually needed.\n    Drainage and extraction. Your doctor may use special tools to gently remove whiteheads and blackheads (comedos) or cysts that haven't cleared up with topical medications. This technique temporarily improves the appearance of your skin, but it might also cause scarring.\n    Steroid injection. Nodular and cystic lesions can be treated by injecting a steroid drug into them. This therapy has resulted in rapid improvement and decreased pain. Side effects may include skin thinning and discoloration in the treated area.\n\n        \n            \n            Treating childrenMost studies of acne drugs have involved people 12 years of age or older. Increasingly, younger children are getting acne as well. The FDA has expanded the number of topical products approved for use in children. And guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology indicate that topical benzoyl peroxide, adapalene and tretinoin in preadolescent children are effective and don't cause increased risk of side effects.\nIf your child has acne, consider consulting a pediatric dermatologist. Ask about drugs to avoid in children, appropriate doses, drug interactions, side effects, and how treatment may affect a child's growth and development.More InformationAcne treatments: Medical procedures may help clear skinAcne scars: What's the best treatment?Birth control pills for acne?Chemical peelDermabrasionLaser resurfacingLight therapyTake action against acneShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Please follow all recommended Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for masking and social distancing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcoustic neuroma is often difficult to diagnose in the early stages because signs and symptoms may be easy to miss and develop slowly over time. Common symptoms such as hearing loss are also associated with many other middle and inner ear problems.\nAfter asking questions about your symptoms, your doctor will conduct an ear exam. Your doctor may order the following tests:\n\n    \n    Hearing test (audiometry). In this test, conducted by a hearing specialist (audiologist), you hear sounds directed to one ear at a time. The audiologist presents a range of sounds of various tones and asks you to indicate each time you hear the sound. Each tone is repeated at faint levels to find out when you can barely hear.\n    The audiologist may also present various words to determine your hearing ability.\n    \n    Imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast dye is usually used to diagnose acoustic neuroma. This imaging test can detect tumors as small as 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter. If MRI is unavailable or you can't have an MRI scan for some reason, computerized tomography (CT) may be used. However, CT scans may miss very small tumors.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your acoustic neuroma-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationAcoustic neuroma care at Mayo ClinicCT scanMRI\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\t\n\n    \n    Acoustic neuroma surgery at Mayo Clinic\n    Surgical removal of the tumor by an experienced neurosurgeon is one of the acoustic neuroma treatment options at Mayo Clinic.\n\n\nYour acoustic neuroma treatment may vary, depending on:\n\n    The size and growth of the acoustic neuroma\n    Your overall health\n    Severity of symptoms\n\nTo treat acoustic neuroma, your doctor may suggest one or more of three potential options: monitoring, surgery or radiation therapy.\n        \n            \n            MonitoringIf you have a small acoustic neuroma that isn't growing or is growing slowly and causes few or no signs or symptoms, you and your doctor may decide to monitor it. Monitoring may be recommended if you're an older adult or otherwise not a good candidate for more-aggressive treatment.\nYour doctor may recommend that you have regular imaging and hearing tests, usually every 6 to 12 months, to determine whether the tumor is growing and how quickly. If the scans show the tumor is growing or if the tumor causes progressive symptoms or other difficulties, you may need to undergo treatment.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryYou may need surgery to remove an acoustic neuroma, especially if the tumor is:\n\n    Continuing to grow\n    Very large\n    Causing symptoms\n\nYour surgeon may use one of several techniques for removing an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size of your tumor, hearing status and other factors.\nThe goal of surgery is to remove the tumor and preserve the facial nerve to prevent facial paralysis. Removing the entire tumor may not be possible in certain cases \u2014 for example, if the tumor is too close to important parts of the brain or the facial nerve.\nSurgery for an acoustic neuroma is performed under general anesthesia and involves removing the tumor through the inner ear or through a window in your skull.\nSometimes, surgical removal of the tumor may worsen symptoms if the hearing, balance, or facial nerves are irritated or damaged during the operation. Hearing may be lost on the side where the surgery is performed, and balance is usually affected temporarily.\nComplications may include:\n\n    Leaking cerebrospinal fluid through the wound or nose\n    Hearing loss\n    Facial weakness or numbness\n    Ringing in the ear\n    Balance problems\n    Persistent headache\n    Rarely, infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis)\n    Very rarely, stroke or brain bleeding\n\n        \n            \n            Radiation therapy\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery\n\t\t\t\tGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to a target.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nThere are several types of radiation therapy used to treat acoustic neuroma:\n\n    \n    Stereotactic radiosurgery. Your doctor may recommend a type of radiation therapy known as stereotactic radiosurgery. It's often used if your tumor is small (less than 2.5 centimeters in diameter), you are an older adult or you cannot tolerate surgery for health reasons.\n    Stereotactic radiosurgery, such as Gamma Knife radiosurgery, uses many tiny gamma rays to deliver a precisely targeted dose of radiation to a tumor without damaging the surrounding tissue or making an incision.\n    The goal of stereotactic radiosurgery is to stop the growth of a tumor, preserve the facial nerve's function and possibly preserve hearing.\n    It may take weeks, months or years before you notice the effects of radiosurgery. Your doctor will monitor your progress with follow-up imaging studies and hearing tests.\n    Risks of radiosurgery include:\n    \n        Hearing loss\n        Ringing in the ear\n        Facial weakness or numbness\n        Balance problems\n        Continued tumor growth\n    \n    \n    Stereotactic radiotherapy. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) delivers a small dose of radiation to the tumor over several sessions. SRT is done to curb the growth of the tumor without damaging surrounding brain tissue.\n    Proton beam therapy. This type of radiation therapy uses high-energy beams of positively charged particles called protons. Protons are delivered to the affected area in targeted doses to treat tumors and minimize radiation exposure to the surrounding area.\n\n        \n            \n            Supportive therapyIn addition to treatment to remove or stop the growth of the tumor, your doctor may recommend supportive therapies to address symptoms or complications of an acoustic neuroma and its treatment, such as dizziness or balance problems.\nCochlear implants or other treatments may also be recommended to treat hearing loss.\t\n\n    \n    Supportive care for acoustic neuroma at Mayo Clinic\n    Supportive care including balance (vestibular) therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy and hearing assistance is part of the comprehensive acoustic neuroma treatment at Mayo Clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

For example, you may notice that you aren't able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased.\nAcromegaly may also cause gradual changes in your face's shape, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow bone, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth.\nBecause acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones.\nOverall, acromegaly signs and symptoms tend to vary from one person to another, and may include any of the following:\n\n    Enlarged hands and feet\n    Enlarged facial features, including the facial bones, lips, nose and tongue\n    Coarse, oily, thickened skin\n    Excessive sweating and body odor\n    Small outgrowths of skin tissue (skin tags)\n    Fatigue and joint or muscle weakness\n    Pain and limited joint mobility\n    A deepened, husky voice due to enlarged vocal cords and sinuses\n    Severe snoring due to obstruction of the upper airway\n    Vision problems\n    Headaches, which may be persistent or severe\n    Menstrual cycle irregularities in women\n    Erectile dysfunction in men\n    Loss of interest in sex\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorIf you have signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly, contact your doctor for an exam.\nAcromegaly usually develops slowly.

It produces GH and a number of other hormones. GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth.\nWhen the pituitary gland releases GH into your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) \u2014 sometimes also called insulin-like growth factor-I, or IGF-I. IGF-1 is what causes your bones and other tissues to grow. Too much GH leads to too much IGF-1, which can cause acromegaly signs, symptoms and complications.\nIn adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too much GH production:\n\n    Pituitary tumors. Most acromegaly cases are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland. The tumor produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly. Some of the symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and impaired vision, are due to the tumor pressing on nearby brain tissues.\n    Nonpituitary tumors. In a few people with acromegaly, tumors in other parts of the body, such as the lungs or pancreas, cause the disorder. Sometimes, these tumors secrete GH. In other cases, the tumors produce a hormone called growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH), which signals the pituitary gland to make more GH.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history and conduct a physical exam.

An elevated IGF-1 level suggests acromegaly.\n    Growth hormone suppression test. This is the best method for confirming an acromegaly diagnosis. During this test, your GH blood level is measured both before and after you drink a preparation of sugar (glucose). In people who don't have acromegaly, the glucose drink typically causes the GH level to fall. But if you have acromegaly, your GH level will tend to stay high.\n    Imaging. Your doctor may recommend an imaging test, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to help pinpoint the location and size of a tumor on your pituitary gland.

Your doctor may recommend another surgery, medications or radiation treatments.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsYour doctor may recommend one of the following medications \u2014 or a combination of medications \u2014 to help your hormone levels return to normal:\n\n    Drugs that reduce growth hormone production (somatostatin analogues). In the body, a brain hormone called somatostatin works against (inhibits) GH production. The drugs octreotide (Sandostatin) and lanreotide (Somatuline Depot) are man-made (synthetic) versions of somatostatin. Taking one of these drugs signals the pituitary gland to produce less GH, and may even reduce the size of a pituitary tumor. Typically, these drugs are injected into the muscles of your buttocks (gluteal muscles) once a month by a health care professional.\n    Drugs to lower hormone levels (dopamine agonists). The oral medications cabergoline and bromocriptine (Parlodel) may help lower levels of GH and IGF-1 in some people. These drugs may also help decrease tumor size. To treat acromegaly, these medications usually need to be taken at high doses, which can increase the risk of side effects. Common side effects of these drugs include nausea, vomiting, stuffy nose, tiredness, dizziness, sleep problems and mood changes.\n    Drug to block the action of GH (growth hormone antagonist). The medication pegvisomant (Somavert) blocks the effect of GH on the body's tissues. Pegvisomant may be particularly helpful for people who haven't had good success with other treatments. Given as a daily injection, this medication can help lower IGF-1 levels and relieve symptoms, but it doesn't lower GH levels or reduce tumor size.\n\n        \n            \n            RadiationIf your surgeon wasn't able to remove the whole tumor during surgery, your doctor may recommend radiation treatment. Radiation therapy destroys any lingering tumor cells and slowly reduces GH levels. It may take years for this treatment to noticeably improve acromegaly symptoms.\nRadiation treatment often lowers levels of other pituitary hormones, too \u2014 not just GH. If you receive radiation treatment, you'll likely need regular follow-up visits with your doctor to make sure that your pituitary gland is working properly, and to check your hormone levels. This follow-up care may last for the rest of your life.\nTypes of radiation therapy include:\n\n    Conventional radiation therapy. This type of radiation therapy is usually given every weekday over a period of four to six weeks. You may not see the full effect of conventional radiation therapy for 10 or more years after treatment.\n    Stereotactic radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery uses 3D imaging to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor cells, while limiting the amount of radiation to normal surrounding tissues. It can usually be delivered in a single dose. This type of radiation may bring GH levels back to normal within five to 10 years.\nMore InformationRadiation therapyStereotactic radiosurgery\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

This can happen in several ways:\n\nBy having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity.\nBy sharing needles. Sharing contaminated IV drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis.\nFrom blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small.\nDuring pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. Mothers who are HIV-positive and get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            How HIV doesn't spreadYou can't become infected with HIV through ordinary contact.

These tests look for antibodies to HIV in blood or saliva. Most rapid HIV tests, including self-tests done at home, are antibody tests. Antibody tests can take three to 12 weeks after you're exposed to become positive.\nNucleic acid tests (NATs). These tests look for the actual virus in your blood (viral load). They also involve blood drawn from a vein. If you might have been exposed to HIV within the past few weeks, your doctor may recommend NAT. NAT will be the first test to become positive after exposure to HIV.\n\nTalk to your doctor about which HIV test is right for you. If any of these tests are negative, you may still need a follow-up test weeks to months later to confirm the results.\n        \n            \n            Tests to stage disease and treatmentIf you've been diagnosed with HIV, it's important to find a specialist trained in diagnosing and treating HIV to help you:\n\nDetermine whether you need additional testing\nDetermine which HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be best for you\nMonitor your progress and work with you to manage your health\n\nIf you receive a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, several tests can help your doctor determine the stage of your disease and the best treatment, including:\n\nCD4 T cell count. CD4 T cells are white blood cells that are specifically targeted and destroyed by HIV. Even if you have no symptoms, HIV infection progresses to AIDS when your CD4 T cell count dips below 200.\nViral load (HIV RNA). This test measures the amount of virus in your blood. After starting HIV treatment the goal is to have an undetectable viral load. This significantly reduces your chances of opportunistic infection and other HIV-related complications.\nDrug resistance. Some strains of HIV are resistant to medications. This test helps your doctor determine if your specific form of the virus has resistance and guides treatment decisions.\n\n\n        \n            \n            Tests for complicationsYour doctor might also order lab tests to check for other infections or complications, including:\n\nTuberculosis\nHepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection\nSTIs\nLiver or kidney damage\nUrinary tract infection\nCervical and anal cancer\nCytomegalovirus\nToxoplasmosis\nMore InformationHIV testingLiver function testsUrinalysis\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Currently, there's no cure for HIV/AIDS. Once you have the infection, your body can't get rid of it. However, there are many medications that can control HIV and prevent complications. These medications are called antiretroviral therapy (ART). Everyone diagnosed with HIV should be started on ART, regardless of their stage of infection or complications.\nART is usually a combination of three or more medications from several different drug classes. This approach has the best chance of lowering the amount of HIV in the blood. There are many ART options that combine three HIV medications into one pill, taken once daily.\nEach class of drugs blocks the virus in different ways. Treatment involves combinations of drugs from different classes to:\n\nAccount for individual drug resistance (viral genotype)\nAvoid creating new drug-resistant strains of HIV\nMaximize suppression of virus in the blood\n\nTwo drugs from one class, plus a third drug from a second class, are typically used.\nThe classes of anti-HIV drugs include:\n\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) turn off a protein needed by HIV to make copies of itself. Examples include efavirenz (Sustiva), rilpivirine (Edurant) and doravirine (Pifeltro).\nNucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are faulty versions of the building blocks that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include abacavir (Ziagen), tenofovir (Viread), emtricitabine (Emtriva), lamivudine (Epivir) and zidovudine (Retrovir). Combination drugs also are available, such as emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada) and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Descovy).\nProtease inhibitors (PIs) inactivate HIV protease, another protein that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista) and lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra).\nIntegrase inhibitors work by disabling a protein called integrase, which HIV uses to insert its genetic material into CD4 T cells. Examples include bictegravir sodium/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumar (Biktarvy), raltegravir (Isentress) and dolutegravir (Tivicay).\nEntry or fusion inhibitors block HIV's entry into CD4 T cells.

Actinic keratoses can be removed by freezing them with liquid nitrogen. Your doctor applies the substance to the affected skin, which causes blistering or peeling. As your skin heals, the damaged cells slough off, allowing new skin to appear. Cryotherapy is the most common treatment. It takes only a few minutes and can be done in your doctor's office. Side effects may include blisters, scarring, changes to skin texture, infection and changes in skin color of the affected area.\n    Scraping (curettage). In this procedure, your doctor uses a device called a curet to scrape off damaged cells. Scraping may be followed by electrosurgery, in which the doctor uses a pencil-shaped instrument to cut and destroy the affected tissue with an electric current. This procedure requires local anesthesia. Side effects may include infection, scarring and changes in skin color of the affected area.\n    Laser therapy. This technique is increasingly used to treat actinic keratosis. Your doctor uses an ablative laser device to destroy the patch, allowing new skin to appear. Side effects may include scarring and discoloration of the affected skin.\n    Photodynamic therapy. Your doctor might apply a light-sensitive chemical solution to the affected skin and then expose it to a special light that will destroy the actinic keratosis.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\n    Consolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nTherapies used in these phases include:\n\n    \n    Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\n    People with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n    \n    Targeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n    \n    Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\n    Prior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n    You can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n    \n    Clinical trials.

A blood test may also show the presence of blast cells \u2014 immature cells normally found in the bone marrow.\n    \n    Bone marrow test. During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells.\n    Doctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. This information helps your doctor develop a treatment plan.\n    \n    Imaging tests. Imaging tests such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may help determine whether cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body.\n    Spinal fluid test.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.\n    Consolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\n    Maintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\n    Preventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.\n\nDepending on your situation, the phases of treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can span two to three years.\nTreatments may include:\n\n    Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\n    Targeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\n    Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n    \n    Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\n    A bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n    \n    \n    Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.\n    CAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.\n    \n    Clinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, the benefits and risks of the treatment may be uncertain. Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor.\n\n        \n            \n            Treatment for older adultsOlder adults, such as those older than 65, tend to experience more complications from treatments. And older adults generally have a worse prognosis than children who are treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia.\nDiscuss your options with your doctor. Based on your overall health and your goals and preferences, you may decide to undergo treatment for your leukemia.\nSome people may choose to forgo treatment for the cancer, instead focusing on treatments that improve their symptoms and help them make the most of the time they have remaining.More InformationAcute lymphocytic leukemia care at Mayo ClinicBone marrow transplantChemotherapyRadiation therapyShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Potential causes include:\n\n    \n    Acetaminophen overdose. Taking too much acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Outside of the United States, acetaminophen is known as paracetamol. Acute liver failure can occur after one very large dose of acetaminophen, or after higher than recommended doses every day for several days.\n    If you or someone you know has taken an overdose of acetaminophen, seek medical attention as quickly as possible. Treatment may prevent liver failure. Don't wait for the signs of liver failure.\n    \n    Prescription medications. Some prescription medications, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants, can cause acute liver failure.\n    Herbal supplements. Herbal drugs and supplements, including kava, ephedra, skullcap and pennyroyal, have been linked to acute liver failure.\n    Hepatitis and other viruses. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis E can cause acute liver failure. Other viruses that can cause acute liver failure include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus.\n    Toxins. Toxins that can cause acute liver failure include the poisonous wild mushroom Amanita phalloides, which is sometimes mistaken for one that is safe to eat. Carbon tetrachloride is another toxin that can cause acute liver failure. It is an industrial chemical found in refrigerants and solvents for waxes, varnishes and other materials.\n    Autoimmune disease. Liver failure can be caused by autoimmune hepatitis \u2014 a disease in which your immune system attacks liver cells, causing inflammation and injury.\n    Diseases of the veins in the liver. Vascular diseases, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, can cause blockages in the veins of the liver and lead to acute liver failure.\n    Metabolic disease. Rare metabolic diseases, such as Wilson's disease and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, infrequently cause acute liver failure.\n    Cancer. Cancer that either begins in or spreads to your liver can cause your liver to fail.\n    Shock. Overwhelming infection (sepsis) and shock can severely impair blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure.\n    Heat stroke. Extreme physical activity in a hot environment can trigger acute liver failure.\n\nSome cases of acute liver failure have no apparent cause.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Tests and procedures used to diagnose acute liver failure include:\n\n    Blood tests. Blood tests are done to determine how well your liver works. A prothrombin time test measures how long it takes your blood to clot. With acute liver failure, blood doesn't clot as quickly as it should.\n    Imaging tests. Your doctor may recommend an ultrasound exam to look at your liver. Such testing may show liver damage and help your doctor determine the cause of your liver problems. Your doctor may also recommend abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at your liver and blood vessels. These tests can look for certain causes of acute liver failure, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome or tumors. They may be used if your doctor suspects a problem and ultrasound testing is negative.\n    Examination of liver tissue. Your doctor may recommend removing a small piece of liver tissue (liver biopsy). Doing so may help your doctor understand why your liver is failing. Since people with acute liver failure are at risk of bleeding during biopsy, the doctor may perform a transjugular liver biopsy. The doctor makes a tiny incision on the right side of your neck, and then passes a thin tube (catheter) into a neck vein, through your heart and into a vein exiting your liver. Your doctor then inserts a needle through the catheter and retrieves a sample of liver tissue.\nMore InformationLiver biopsyLiver function testsUltrasound\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "People with acute liver failure are often treated in the intensive care unit of a hospital in a facility that can perform a liver transplant, if necessary. Your doctor may try to treat the liver damage itself, but in many cases, treatment involves controlling complications and giving your liver time to heal.\nAcute liver failure treatments may include:\n\n    \n    Medications to reverse poisoning. Acute liver failure caused by acetaminophen overdose is treated with a medication called acetylcysteine. This medication may also help treat other causes of acute liver failure. Mushroom and other poisonings also may be treated with drugs that can reverse the effects of the toxin and may reduce liver damage.\n    Your doctor will also work to control signs and symptoms you're experiencing and try to prevent complications caused by acute liver failure. Your care may include:\n    \n    Relieving pressure caused by excess fluid in the brain. Cerebral edema caused by acute liver failure can increase pressure on your brain. Medications can help reduce the fluid buildup in your brain.\n    Liver transplant. When acute liver failure can't be reversed, the only treatment may be a liver transplant. During a liver transplant, a surgeon removes your damaged liver and replaces it with a healthy liver from a donor.\n    Screening for infections. Your medical team will take samples of your blood and urine every now and then to be tested for infection. If your doctor suspects that you have an infection, you'll receive medications to treat the infection.\n    Preventing severe bleeding. Your doctor can give you medications to reduce the risk of bleeding. If you lose a lot of blood, your doctor may perform tests to find the source of the blood loss. You may require blood transfusions.\n    Providing nutritional support. If you're unable to eat, you may need supplements to treat nutritional deficiencies.\n\n        \n            \n            Future treatmentsScientists continue to research new treatments for acute liver failure, especially those that could reduce or delay the need for a liver transplant. While several potential future treatments are in the pipeline, it's important to remember they are experimental and may not yet be available.\nAmong those being studied are:\n\n    Artificial hepatic assist devices. A machine would do the job of the liver, much like dialysis helps when the kidneys stop working. There are many different types of devices being studied. Research suggests that some, but not all, devices may improve survival. A well-controlled multicenter trial showed that one system, called an extracorporeal liver support system, helped some people with acute liver failure survive without a transplant. The treatment is also called high-volume plasma exchange. However, more study is needed for this therapy.\n    Hepatocyte transplantation. Transplanting only the cells of the liver \u2014 not the entire organ \u2014 may temporarily delay the need for a liver transplant. In some cases, it could lead to a complete recovery. A shortage of good-quality donor livers has limited the use of this treatment.\n    Auxiliary liver transplantation. This procedure involves removing a small piece of your liver and replacing it with a similarly sized graft. This allows your own liver to regenerate without the need for immunosuppressant drugs. At this time, auxiliary liver transplantation is a difficult procedure that needs more time to be evaluated.\n    Xenotransplantation. This type of transplant replaces the human liver with one from an animal or other nonhuman source. Doctors performed experimental liver transplants using pig livers several decades ago, but results were disappointing. However, advancements in immune and transplant medicine have prompted researchers to consider this treatment again. It may help provide support for those waiting for a human liver transplant.\nMore InformationLiver transplant\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

In other cases, acute kidney failure may cause you to have too much fluid, leading to swelling in your arms and legs. In these cases, your doctor may recommend medications (diuretics) to cause your body to expel extra fluids.\n    Medications to control blood potassium. If your kidneys aren't properly filtering potassium from your blood, your doctor may prescribe calcium, glucose or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kionex) to prevent the accumulation of high levels of potassium in your blood. Too much potassium in the blood can cause dangerous irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and muscle weakness.\n    Medications to restore blood calcium levels. If the levels of calcium in your blood drop too low, your doctor may recommend an infusion of calcium.\n    Dialysis to remove toxins from your blood. If toxins build up in your blood, you may need temporary hemodialysis \u2014 often referred to simply as dialysis \u2014 to help remove toxins and excess fluids from your body while your kidneys heal.

Others may need admission to a hospital or a residential treatment center.\nWithdrawal from different categories of drugs \u2014 such as depressants, stimulants or opioids \u2014 produces different side effects and requires different approaches.

The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more impaired you become. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, impaired judgment, slurred speech, impaired attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called \"blackouts,\" where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma or even death.\n    Alcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to four or five days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures.

ADHD symptoms start before age 12, and in some children, they're noticeable as early as 3 years of age. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood.\nADHD occurs more often in males than in females, and behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to be quietly inattentive.\nThere are three subtypes of ADHD:\n\n    Predominantly inattentive. The majority of symptoms fall under inattention.\n    Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive. The majority of symptoms are hyperactive and impulsive.\n    Combined.

Young children are naturally energetic \u2014 they often are still full of energy long after they've worn their parents out. In addition, some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified as having ADHD just because they're different from their friends or siblings.\nChildren who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends are likely struggling with something other than ADHD.

Stimulant medication may cause an increased blood pressure or heart rate, but the increased risk of serious adverse effects or sudden death is still unproved. However, the doctor should evaluate your child for any heart condition or family history of heart disease before prescribing a stimulant medication and monitor your child during stimulant use.\n    Psychiatric problems. Stimulant medications may rarely increase the risk for agitation or psychotic or manic symptoms with stimulant medications use. Contact the doctor immediately if your child has sudden new or worsening behavior or sees or hears things that aren't real while taking stimulant medication.\n\n        \n            \n            Other medicationsOther medications that may be effective in treating ADHD include:\n\n    Atomoxetine (Strattera)\n    Antidepressants such as bupropion (Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL, others)\n    Guanfacine (Intuniv)\n    Clonidine (Catapres, Kapvay)\n\nAtomoxetine and antidepressants work slower than stimulants do and may take several weeks before they take full effect.

Parents may be concerned about stimulants and the risk of abuse and addiction. Stimulant medications are considered safe when your child takes the medication as prescribed by the doctor. Your child should see the doctor regularly to determine if the medication needs to be adjusted.\nOn the other hand, there's concern that other people might misuse or abuse stimulant medication prescribed for children and teenagers with ADHD. To keep your child's medications safe and to make sure your child is getting the right dose at the right time:\n\n\tGive medications carefully. Children and teens shouldn't be in charge of their own ADHD medication without proper supervision.\n\tAt home, keep medication locked in a childproof container. And store medication away from the reach of children. An overdose of stimulant drugs is serious and potentially fatal.\n\tDon't send supplies of medication to school with your child. Deliver any medication yourself to the school nurse or health office.\n\n        \n            \n            ADHD behavior therapyChildren with ADHD often benefit from behavior therapy, social skills training, parent skills training and counseling, which may be provided by a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker or other mental health professional. Some children with ADHD may also have other conditions such as an anxiety disorder or depression. In these cases, counseling may help both ADHD and the coexisting problem.\nExamples of therapy include:\n\n    Behavior therapy. Teachers and parents can learn behavior-changing strategies, such as token reward systems and timeouts, for dealing with difficult situations.\n    Social skills training. This can help children learn appropriate social behaviors.\n    Parenting skills training. This can help parents develop ways to understand and guide their child's behavior.\n    Psychotherapy. This allows older children with ADHD to talk about issues that bother them, explore negative behavior patterns and learn ways to deal with their symptoms.\n    Family therapy. Family therapy can help parents and siblings deal with the stress of living with someone who has ADHD.\n\nThe best results occur when a team approach is used, with teachers, parents, therapists and physicians working together. Educate yourself about ADHD and available services. Work with your child's teachers and refer them to reliable sources of information to support their efforts in the classroom.\n        \n            \n            New medical deviceThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new medical device to treat children with ADHD who are 7 to 12 years old and not taking ADHD prescription medicine. Only available by prescription, it's called the Monarch external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (eTNS) System.\nAbout the size of a cell phone, the eTNS device can be used at home under parental supervision, when the child is sleeping. The device generates low-level electrical stimulation which moves through a wire to a small patch placed on the child's forehead, sending signals to areas of the brain related to attention, emotion and behavior.\nIf eTNS is being considered, it's important to discuss precautions, expectations and possible side effects. Get complete information and instructions from your health care professional.\n        \n            \n            Ongoing treatmentIf your child is being treated for ADHD, he or she should see the doctor regularly until symptoms have largely improved, and then typically every three to six months if symptoms are stable.\nCall the doctor if your child has any medication side effects, such as loss of appetite, trouble sleeping or increased irritability, or if your child's ADHD symptoms have not shown much improvement with initial treatment.More InformationAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children care at Mayo ClinicFamily therapyPsychotherapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm.\n    Difficulty digesting food, such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heartburn, all due to changes in digestive function.\n    Inability to recognize low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), because the warning signals, such as getting shaky, aren't there.\n    Sweating abnormalities, such as sweating too much or too little, which affect the ability to regulate body temperature.\n    Sluggish pupil reaction, making it difficult to adjust from light to dark and seeing well when driving at night.\n    Exercise intolerance, which can occur if your heart rate stays the same instead of adjusting to your activity level.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorSeek medical care promptly if you begin having any of the signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy, particularly if you have diabetes that's poorly controlled.\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends annual autonomic neuropathy screening beginning when you receive your diagnosis. For people with type 1 diabetes, the association advises annual screening beginning five years after diagnosis.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Many health conditions can cause autonomic neuropathy. It can also be a side effect of treatments for other diseases, such as cancer. Some common causes of autonomic neuropathy include:\n\n    Diabetes, especially when poorly controlled, is the most common cause of autonomic neuropathy. Diabetes can gradually cause nerve damage throughout the body.\n    Abnormal protein buildup in organs (amyloidosis), which affects the organs and the nervous system.\n    \n    Autoimmune diseases, in which your immune system attacks and damages parts of your body, including your nerves. Examples include Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease. Guillain-Barre syndrome is an autoimmune disease that happens rapidly and can affect autonomic nerves.\n    An abnormal attack by the immune system that occurs as a result of some cancers (paraneoplastic syndrome) is another possible cause.\n    \n    Certain medications, including some drugs used in cancer treatment (chemotherapy).\n    Some viruses and bacteria, such as HIV and those that cause botulism and Lyme disease.\n    Certain inherited disorders also can cause autonomic neuropathy.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Autonomic neuropathy is a possible complication of a number of diseases, and the tests you'll need depend on your symptoms and risk factors for autonomic neuropathy.\n        \n            \n            When you have known risk factors for autonomic neuropathyIf you have conditions that increase your risk of autonomic neuropathy, such as diabetes, and have symptoms of the condition, your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nIf you are undergoing cancer treatment with a drug known to cause nerve damage, your doctor will check for signs of neuropathy.\n        \n            \n            When you don't have risk factors for autonomic neuropathyIf you have symptoms of autonomic neuropathy but no risk factors, the diagnosis can be more involved. Your doctor will probably review your medical history, discuss your symptoms and do a physical exam.\nYour doctor might recommend tests to evaluate autonomic functions, including:\n\n    Autonomic function tests. These tests measure how your heart rate and blood pressure respond during exercises such as deep breathing and forcefully exhaling (Valsalva maneuver).\n    \n    Tilt-table test. This test monitors the response of blood pressure and heart rate to changes in posture and position, simulating what occurs when you stand up after lying down. You lie flat on a table, which is then tilted to raise the upper part of your body. Normally, your body narrows blood vessels and increases heart rate to compensate for the drop in blood pressure. This response may be slowed or abnormal if you have autonomic neuropathy.\n    A simpler test for this response involves standing for a minute, then squatting for a minute and then standing again while blood pressure and heart rate are monitored.\n    \n    Gastrointestinal tests. Gastric-emptying tests are the most common tests to check for digestive abnormalities such as slow digestion and delayed emptying of the stomach (gastroparesis). These tests are usually done by a doctor who specializes in digestive disorders (gastroenterologist).\n    Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test. This test evaluates how the nerves that regulate your sweat glands respond to stimulation. A small electrical current passes through capsules placed on your forearm, upper and lower leg, and foot, while a computer analyzes the response of your nerves and sweat glands. You might feel warmth or a tingling sensation during the test.\n    Thermoregulatory sweat test. You're coated with a powder that changes color when you sweat. While you lie in a chamber with a slowly increasing temperature, digital photos document the results as you begin to sweat. Your sweat pattern might help confirm a diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy or suggest other causes for decreased or increased sweating.\n    Urinalysis and bladder function (urodynamic) tests. If you have bladder or urinary signs and symptoms, a series of urine and bladder tests can evaluate bladder function.\n    Ultrasound. If you have bladder signs and symptoms, your doctor might do an ultrasound in which high-frequency sound waves create an image of the bladder and other parts of the urinary tract.\nMore InformationTilt table testUltrasound\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment of autonomic neuropathy includes:\n\n    Treating the underlying disease. The first goal of treating autonomic neuropathy is to manage the disease or condition damaging your nerves. For example, if the underlying cause is diabetes, you'll need to tightly control blood sugar to prevent autonomic neuropathy from progressing. About half of the time, no underlying cause for autonomic neuropathy is found.\n    Managing specific symptoms. Some treatments can relieve the symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. Treatment is based on what part of your body is most affected by nerve damage.\n\n        \n            \n            Digestive (gastrointestinal) symptomsYour doctor may recommend:\n\n    Diet changes. You might need to increase dietary fiber and fluids. Fiber supplements, such as Metamucil or Citrucel, also might help. Slowly increase fiber to avoid gas and bloating.\n    Medication to help your stomach empty. A prescription drug called metoclopramide (Reglan) helps your stomach empty faster by increasing the contractions of the digestive tract. This medication can cause drowsiness and isn't advised for long-term use.\n    Medications to ease constipation. Over-the-counter laxatives can help ease constipation. Ask your doctor how often you should use a laxative.\n    Medications to ease diarrhea. Antibiotics can help treat diarrhea by preventing excess bacterial growth in the intestines, and over-the-counter antidiarrheal medication might be helpful.\n\n        \n            \n            Urinary symptomsYour doctor may suggest:\n\n    Retraining your bladder. Following a schedule of when to drink fluids and when to urinate can help increase your bladder's capacity and retrain your bladder to empty completely at the appropriate times.\n    Medication to manage bladder symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe medications that decrease an overactive bladder. Other medications may help empty your bladder.\n    Urinary assistance (catheterization). A tube is guided through your urethra to empty your bladder.\n\n        \n            \n            Sexual dysfunctionFor men with erectile dysfunction, your doctor might recommend:\n\n    \n    Medications that enable erections. Drugs such as sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis) and avanafil (Stendra) can help you achieve and maintain an erection. Possible side effects include low blood pressure, mild headache, flushing, upset stomach and changes in color vision.\n    If you have a history of heart disease, arrhythmia, stroke or high blood pressure, use these medications with caution. Also avoid taking these medications if you are taking any type of organic nitrates. Seek immediate medical assistance if you have an erection that lasts longer than four hours.\n    \n    External vacuum pump. This device helps pull blood into the penis using a hand pump. A tension ring helps keep the blood in place, maintaining the erection for up to 30 minutes.\n\nFor women with sexual symptoms, your doctor might recommend:\n\n    Vaginal lubricants to decrease dryness and make sexual intercourse more comfortable and enjoyable. \n    Flibanserin (Addyi) for premenopausal women with low sexual desire.\n\n        \n            \n            Heart rhythm and blood pressure symptomsAutonomic neuropathy can cause a number of heart rate and blood pressure problems. Your doctor might prescribe:\n\n    A high-salt, high-fluid diet. If your blood pressure drops when you stand up, a high-salt, high-fluid diet can help maintain your blood pressure. This is generally only recommended for severe cases of blood pressure problems, as this treatment may cause blood pressure that is too high or swelling of the feet, ankles or legs. This treatment shouldn't be used in patients with heart failure.\n    Compression garments. A binder worn around the waist or thigh-high compression stockings may help improve blood flow.\n    \n    Medications to raise your blood pressure. If you feel faint or dizzy when you stand up, your doctor might suggest medications. Fludrocortisone helps your body retain salt, which helps regulate your blood pressure.\n    Midodrine (Orvaten) and droxidopa (Northera) can help raise blood pressure. But these drugs can cause high blood pressure when you're lying down. Pyridostigmine (Mestinon) may help keep blood pressure stable when standing.\n    \n    Medication to regulate your heart rate. A class of medications called beta blockers helps regulate your heart rate if it goes too high during physical activity.\n\n        \n            \n            SweatingIf you sweat too much, your doctor might prescribe a medication that decreases sweating. Glycopyrrolate can decrease sweating. Side effects can include diarrhea, dry mouth, urinary retention, blurred vision, changes in heart rate, headache, loss of taste and drowsiness. Glycopyrrolate can also increase the risk of heat-related illness, such as heatstroke, from a reduced ability to sweat.More InformationAcupuncture\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

{"Diseases": "Autoimmune pancreatitis", "Symptoms": "Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is difficult to diagnose. Often, it doesn't cause any symptoms. Symptoms and signs of type 1 AIP are similar to those of pancreatic cancer.\nPancreatic cancer signs and symptoms can include:\n\n    Dark urine\n    Pale stools or stools that float in the toilet\n    Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice)\n    Pain in your upper abdomen or middle part of your back\n    Nausea and vomiting\n    Weakness or extreme tiredness\n    Loss of appetite or feelings of fullness\n    Weight loss for no known reason\n\nThe most common sign of type 1 AIP, present in about 80% of people, is painless jaundice, caused by blocked bile ducts. Type 2 AIP can present with recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. Pain in the upper abdomen, a common symptom of pancreatic cancer, is frequently absent in autoimmune pancreatitis.\nDifferences between type 1 and type 2 AIP are:\n\n    In type 1 AIP, the disease may affect other organs in addition to the pancreas.

However, an accurate diagnosis is extremely important. Undiagnosed cancer may result in delaying or not receiving necessary treatment.\nPeople with AIP tend to have a general enlargement of the pancreas, but they may also have a mass in the pancreas. To pinpoint the diagnosis and determine which type of AIP you have, blood and imaging tests are necessary.\n        \n            \n            TestsNo single test or characteristic feature identifies autoimmune pancreatitis. Consensus guidelines for diagnosis use a combination of imaging, blood tests and biopsy results.\nSpecific tests may include:\n\n    Imaging tests. Tests of your pancreas and other organs may include CT, MRI, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).\n    \n    Blood tests. You will be tested for elevated levels of an immunoglobulin called IgG4, produced by your immune system. People with type 1 AIP, but usually not with type 2 AIP, will have highly elevated blood levels of IgG4.\n    However a positive test doesn't necessarily mean that you have the disease. A small number of people who don't have autoimmune pancreatitis, including some with pancreatic cancer, also have high blood levels of IgG4.\n    \n    \n    Endoscopic core biopsy. In this test, pathologists analyze a sample of pancreatic tissue in the laboratory. AIP has a distinctive appearance that can be easily recognized under a microscope by an expert pathologist. Doctors insert a small tube (endoscope) through the mouth into the stomach and, guided by ultrasound, remove some tissue from the pancreas using a special needle.\n    The challenge is obtaining a sample of tissue large enough to analyze, rather than just a few cells. This procedure is not widely available, and results may not be conclusive.\n    \n    Steroid trial. Autoimmune pancreatitis generally responds to steroids; doctors sometimes use a trial course of this drug to confirm a diagnosis. However, this strategy should ideally be under expert guidance, be used sparingly and only be done when there is strong evidence to support a diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis. Response to corticosteroids is measured by CT and improvement in serum IgG4 levels.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your autoimmune pancreatitis-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\n\tBiliary stenting. Before starting medication, sometimes doctors will insert a tube to drain the biliary ducts (biliary stenting) in people with symptoms of obstructive jaundice. Often, though, jaundice improves with steroid treatment alone. Sometimes drainage is recommended if the diagnosis is uncertain. Tissue samples and cells from the bile duct may be obtained at the time of stent placement.\n\tSteroids. Symptoms of autoimmune pancreatitis often improve after a short course of prednisolone or prednisone. Many people respond quickly, even dramatically. Sometimes people get better without any treatment.\n\t\n\t\tImmunosuppressants and immunomodulators. About 30% to 50% of the time in type 1 AIP and less than 10% of the time in type 2 AIP, the disease relapses, requiring additional treatment, sometimes long term.\n\t\tTo help reduce the serious side effects associated with extended steroid use, doctors often add drugs that suppress or modify the immune system, sometimes called steroid-sparing medications, to the treatment. You may be able to stop taking steroids altogether depending on your response to steroid-sparing medication.\n\t\tImmunosuppressants and immunomodulators include mycophenolate (CellCept), mercaptopurine (Purinethol, Purixan), azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan) and rituximab (Rituxan). In general, they have been used in small sample groups and long-term benefits are still being studied.\n\t\n\tMonitoring of other organ involvement. Type 1 AIP often is associated with other organ involvement, including enlarged lymph nodes and salivary glands, scarring of the bile ducts, liver inflammation, and kidney disease. Although these signs may lessen or disappear completely with steroid therapy, your doctor will continue to monitor you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

Doctors perform a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the degree and type of liver damage. During the procedure, a small amount of liver tissue is removed, using a thin needle that's passed into your liver through a small incision in your skin. The sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis.\nMore InformationLiver biopsy\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Regardless of which type of autoimmune hepatitis you have, the goal of treatment is to slow or stop the immune system attack on your liver. This may help slow the progression of the disease. To meet this goal, you'll need medications that lower immune system activity. The initial treatment is usually prednisone. A second medication, azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), may be recommended in addition to prednisone.\nPrednisone, especially when taken long term, can cause a wide range of serious side effects, including diabetes, thinning bones (osteoporosis), broken bones (osteonecrosis), high blood pressure, cataracts, glaucoma and weight gain.\nDoctors typically prescribe prednisone at a high dose for about the first month of treatment. Then, to reduce the risk of side effects, they gradually reduce the dose over the next several months until reaching the lowest possible dose that controls the disease. Adding azathioprine also helps you avoid prednisone side effects.\nAlthough you may experience remission a few years after starting treatment, the disease often returns if the drug is discontinued. Depending on your situation, you may require lifelong treatment.\n        \n            \n            Liver transplantWhen medications don't halt the progress of the disease or you develop irreversible scarring (cirrhosis) or liver failure, the remaining option is a liver transplant.\nDuring a liver transplant, your diseased liver is removed and replaced with a healthy liver from a donor. Liver transplants most often use livers from deceased organ donors. In some cases, a living-donor liver transplant can be used. During a living-donor liver transplant, you receive only a portion of a healthy liver from a living donor.

{"Diseases": "Autism spectrum disorder", "Symptoms": "Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years.\nEach child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity \u2014 from low functioning to high functioning.\nSome children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence \u2014 they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations.\nBecause of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function.\nBelow are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Social communication and interactionA child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs:\n\n    Fails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times\n    Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world\n    Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression\n    Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences\n    Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items\n    Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech\n    Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them\n    Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions\n    Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings\n    Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest\n    Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive\n    Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Patterns of behaviorA child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs:\n\n    Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping\n    Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging\n    Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change\n    Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language\n    Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object\n    Is unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature\n    Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play\n    Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus\n    Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture\n\nAs they mature, some children with autism spectrum disorder become more engaged with others and show fewer disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives. Others, however, continue to have difficulty with language or social skills, and the teen years can bring worse behavioral and emotional problems.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorBabies develop at their own pace, and many don't follow exact timelines found in some parenting books.

Given the complexity of the disorder, and the fact that symptoms and severity vary, there are probably many causes. Both genetics and environment may play a role.\n\n    Genetics. Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder. For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Still other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously.\n    Environmental factors. Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering autism spectrum disorder.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            No link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorderOne of the greatest controversies in autism spectrum disorder centers on whether a link exists between the disorder and childhood vaccines. Despite extensive research, no reliable study has shown a link between autism spectrum disorder and any vaccines. In fact, the original study that ignited the debate years ago has been retracted due to poor design and questionable research methods.\nAvoiding childhood vaccinations can place your child and others in danger of catching and spreading serious diseases, including whooping cough (pertussis), measles or mumps.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your child's doctor will look for signs of developmental delays at regular checkups. If your child shows any symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, you'll likely be referred to a specialist who treats children with autism spectrum disorder, such as a child psychiatrist or psychologist, pediatric neurologist, or developmental pediatrician, for an evaluation.\nBecause autism spectrum disorder varies widely in symptoms and severity, making a diagnosis may be difficult. There isn't a specific medical test to determine the disorder. Instead, a specialist may:\n\n    Observe your child and ask how your child's social interactions, communication skills and behavior have developed and changed over time\n    Give your child tests covering hearing, speech, language, developmental level, and social and behavioral issues\n    Present structured social and communication interactions to your child and score the performance\n    Use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association\n    Include other specialists in determining a diagnosis\n    Recommend genetic testing to identify whether your child has a genetic disorder such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "No cure exists for autism spectrum disorder, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. The goal of treatment is to maximize your child's ability to function by reducing autism spectrum disorder symptoms and supporting development and learning. Early intervention during the preschool years can help your child learn critical social, communication, functional and behavioral skills.\nThe range of home-based and school-based treatments and interventions for autism spectrum disorder can be overwhelming, and your child's needs may change over time. Your health care provider can recommend options and help identify resources in your area.\nIf your child is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, talk to experts about creating a treatment strategy and build a team of professionals to meet your child's needs.\nTreatment options may include:\n\n    Behavior and communication therapies. Many programs address the range of social, language and behavioral difficulties associated with autism spectrum disorder. Some programs focus on reducing problem behaviors and teaching new skills. Other programs focus on teaching children how to act in social situations or communicate better with others. Applied behavior analysis (ABA) can help children learn new skills and generalize these skills to multiple situations through a reward-based motivation system.\n    Educational therapies. Children with autism spectrum disorder often respond well to highly structured educational programs. Successful programs typically include a team of specialists and a variety of activities to improve social skills, communication and behavior. Preschool children who receive intensive, individualized behavioral interventions often show good progress.\n    Family therapies. Parents and other family members can learn how to play and interact with their children in ways that promote social interaction skills, manage problem behaviors, and teach daily living skills and communication.\n    Other therapies. Depending on your child's needs, speech therapy to improve communication skills, occupational therapy to teach activities of daily living, and physical therapy to improve movement and balance may be beneficial. A psychologist can recommend ways to address problem behavior.\n    Medications. No medication can improve the core signs of autism spectrum disorder, but specific medications can help control symptoms. For example, certain medications may be prescribed if your child is hyperactive; antipsychotic drugs are sometimes used to treat severe behavioral problems; and antidepressants may be prescribed for anxiety. Keep all health care providers updated on any medications or supplements your child is taking. Some medications and supplements can interact, causing dangerous side effects.\n\n        \n            \n            Managing other medical and mental health conditionsIn addition to autism spectrum disorder, children, teens and adults can also experience:\n\n    Medical health issues. Children with autism spectrum disorder may also have medical issues, such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, limited food preferences or stomach problems. Ask your child's doctor how to best manage these conditions together.\n    Problems with transition to adulthood. Teens and young adults with autism spectrum disorder may have difficulty understanding body changes. Also, social situations become increasingly complex in adolescence, and there may be less tolerance for individual differences. Behavior problems may be challenging during the teen years.\n    Other mental health disorders. Teens and adults with autism spectrum disorder often experience other mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Your doctor, mental health professional, and community advocacy and service organizations can offer help.\n\n        \n            \n            Planning for the futureChildren with autism spectrum disorder typically continue to learn and compensate for problems throughout life, but most will continue to require some level of support.

A. Normal breast duct is shown. B. An overgrowth of normal cells may develop in the breast duct (hyperplasia). C. Over time, the cells develop abnormalitities and continue accumulating (atypical hyperplasia). D. The abnormal cells may continue to change in appearance and multiply, evolving into ductal carcinoma in situ. E. Eventually the cancer cells grow beyond the breast duct (invasive ductal carcinoma) and can spread to other areas of the body.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not clear what causes atypical hyperplasia.\nAtypical hyperplasia forms when breast cells become abnormal in number, size, shape, growth pattern and appearance. The appearance of the abnormal cells determines the type of atypical hyperplasia:\n\n    Atypical ductal hyperplasia describes abnormal cells within the breast ducts.\n    Atypical lobular hyperplasia describes abnormal cells within the breast lobules.\n\nAtypical hyperplasia is thought to be part of the complex transition of cells that may accumulate and evolve into breast cancer. The progression to breast cancer typically involves:\n\n    Hyperplasia. The process begins when normal cell development and growth become disrupted, causing an overproduction of normal-looking cells (hyperplasia).\n    Atypical hyperplasia. The excess cells stack upon one another and begin to take on an abnormal appearance.\n    Noninvasive (in situ) cancer. The abnormal cells continue to progress in appearance and multiply, evolving into in situ cancer, in which cancer cells remain confined to milk ducts.\n    Invasive cancer. The abnormal cells accumulate within the duct and continue to multiply and transition to become cancer cells. Invasive cancer tends to invade surrounding tissue, blood vessels or lymph channels.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Atypical hyperplasia is usually discovered after a biopsy to evaluate a suspicious area found during a clinical breast exam or on an imaging test, such as a mammogram or ultrasound.\nTo further evaluate atypical hyperplasia, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove a larger sample of tissue to look for breast cancer. A diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia may lead to a surgical biopsy (wide local excision or lumpectomy) to remove all of the affected tissue. The pathologist looks at the larger specimen for evidence of in situ or invasive cancer.More InformationBreast self-exam for breast awarenessMRINeedle biopsy\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Atypical hyperplasia is generally treated with surgery to remove the abnormal cells and to make sure no in situ or invasive cancer also is present in the area. Doctors often recommend more-intensive screening for breast cancer and medications to reduce your breast cancer risk.\n        \n            \n            Follow-up tests to monitor for breast cancerYour doctor may recommend that you undergo tests to screen for breast cancer. This may increase the chance that breast cancer is detected early, when a cure is more likely. Talk about your breast cancer screening options with your doctor. Your options may include:\n\n    Self-exams for breast awareness in order to develop breast familiarity and to detect any unusual breast changes\n    Clinical breast exams by your health care provider annually\n    Screening mammograms annually\n    Additional breast cancer screening tests, such as breast MRI or molecular breast imaging, based on your other risk factors for breast cancer\n\n        \n            \n            Ways to reduce your risk of breast cancerTo reduce your risk of developing breast cancer, your doctor may recommend that you:\n\n    \n    Take preventive medications. Treatment with a selective estrogen receptor modulator, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene (Evista), for five years may reduce the risk of breast cancer.\n    These drugs work by blocking estrogen from binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue. Estrogen is thought to fuel the growth of some breast cancers.\n    Tamoxifen is the only drug approved for use in premenopausal women.\n    Another option for postmenopausal women may be aromatase inhibitors, such as exemestane (Aromasin) and anastrozole (Arimidex), which decrease production of estrogen in the body.\n    \n    Avoid menopausal hormone therapy. Researchers have concluded that combination hormone therapy to treat symptoms of menopause \u2014 estrogen plus progestin \u2014 increases breast cancer risk after menopause. Many breast cancers depend on hormones for growth.\n    Participate in a clinical trial. Clinical trials test new treatments not yet available to the public at large that may prove helpful in reducing breast cancer risk associated with atypical hyperplasia. Ask your doctor if you're a candidate for any clinical trials.\n    \n    Consider risk-reducing (prophylactic) mastectomy. If you have a very high risk of breast cancer, a risk-reducing mastectomy \u2014 surgery to remove one or both breasts \u2014 may be an option to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in the future.\n    You might be considered at very high risk of breast cancer if you have a genetic mutation in one of the breast cancer genes or you have a very strong family history of breast cancer that suggests a likelihood of having such a genetic mutation.\n    But this surgery isn't right for everyone. Discuss with your doctor the risks, benefits and limitations of this risk-reducing surgery in light of your personal circumstances.\n    If you have a strong family history of breast cancer, you might benefit from meeting with a genetic counselor to evaluate your risk of carrying a genetic mutation and the role of genetic testing in your situation.\n    \n    Make healthy lifestyle choices.

Atypical depression often starts in the teenage years, earlier than other types of depression, and can have a more long-term (chronic) course.\nAs with other types of depression, a combination of factors may be involved. These include:\n\n    Brain differences. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that carry signals to other parts of your brain and body. When these chemicals are abnormal or impaired, the function of nerve receptors and nerve systems change, leading to depression.\n    Inherited traits. Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives also have the condition.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "These exams and tests can help your doctor rule out other problems that could be causing your symptoms, determine a diagnosis and check for any related complications:\n\n    Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and ask in-depth questions about your health to help determine what may be causing your depression. In some cases, depression may be linked to an underlying physical health problem.\n    Lab tests. For example, your doctor may do a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) or test your thyroid to make sure it's functioning properly.\n    Psychological evaluation. To check for signs of atypical depression, your doctor or mental health professional will talk to you about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. He or she may have you fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions.\n    DSM-5. To help make a diagnosis, your mental health professional may compare your symptoms with the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.\nMore InformationComplete blood count (CBC)\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy) are effective for most people with depression, including atypical depression. Your primary care doctor or psychiatrist can prescribe medications to relieve symptoms. However, many people with atypical depression benefit from also seeing a psychologist or other mental health professional.\nIf you have severe depression, you may need a hospital stay or you may need to participate in an outpatient treatment program until your symptoms improve.\nHere's a closer look at treatment options.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsTypes of medications for atypical depression can include:\n\n    Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). MAOIs are the oldest class of antidepressant medications, but they can have serious side effects. However, some experts feel that MAOIs, especially phenelzine (Nardil), can be effective for atypical depression. They may also help with anxiety, panic and other specific symptoms. Using MAOIs requires a strict diet because of dangerous (or even deadly) interactions with certain foods and some prescription and over-the-counter medications, such as decongestants and certain herbal supplements. MAOIs can't be combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n    Other antidepressants. SSRIs, most notably sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Prozac), can be an effective alternative to MAOIs. Tricyclic antidepressants are not as effective, but may be an option for treating atypical depression. Other antidepressants may be beneficial, but have not been systematically studied for atypical depression.\n\nDiscuss possible benefits, risks and side effects of medications with your doctor and pharmacist. You may need to try several medications or a combination of medications before you find one that works. This requires patience, as some medications need several weeks or longer to take full effect and for side effects to ease as your body adjusts.\n        \n            \n            PsychotherapyPsychotherapy \u2014 also known as talk therapy \u2014 is a general term for treating depression by talking about your condition and related issues with a mental health professional.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as well as other types of psychotherapy, can help you:\n\n    Learn how to identify and change unhealthy behavior or thoughts\n    Explore relationships and experiences\n    Find better ways to cope and solve problems\n    Set realistic goals for your life\n    Regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life\n    Help ease depression symptoms such as hopelessness and anger\n\nAs part of your treatment, it's important to also address other conditions that often accompany atypical depression, in particular anxiety and drug or alcohol misuse, as they can make your depression more difficult to treat.More InformationPsychotherapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Because they all seem to work equally well, you and your doctor can decide which one is best for you.\n\n    Vaginal estrogen cream (Estrace, Premarin). You insert this cream directly into your vagina with an applicator, usually at bedtime. Typically women use it daily for one to three weeks and then one to three times a week thereafter, but your doctor will let you know how much cream to use and how often to insert it.\n    Vaginal estrogen suppositories (Imvexxy). These low-dose estrogen suppositories are inserted about 2 inches into the vaginal canal daily for weeks. Then, the suppositories only need to be inserted twice a week.\n    Vaginal estrogen ring (Estring, Femring). You or your doctor inserts a soft, flexible ring into the upper part of the vagina. The ring releases a consistent dose of estrogen while in place and needs to be replaced about every three months. Many women like the convenience this offers. A different, higher dose ring is considered a systemic rather than topical treatment.\n    Vaginal estrogen tablet (Vagifem). You use a disposable applicator to place a vaginal estrogen tablet in your vagina. Your doctor will let you know how often to insert the tablet.

Blood tests are usually done to check for other health conditions that could cause your symptoms, such as thyroid disease.\nYour doctor may also order several tests to check your heart health. Tests to diagnosis SVT include:\n\n    Electrocardiogram (ECG). During an ECG, sensors (electrodes) that can detect the electrical activity of your heart are attached to your chest and sometimes to your limbs. An ECG measures the timing and duration of each electrical phase in your heartbeat.\n    Holter monitor. This portable ECG device can be worn for a day or more to record your heart's activity as you go about your routine.\n    Event monitor or mobile telemetry device. For sporadic episodes of SVT, you may be asked to wear an ECG device for a longer period of time (up to 30 days or until you have an SVT episode or arrhythmia or typical symptoms).\n    Echocardiogram. In this noninvasive test, a hand-held device (transducer) placed on your chest uses sound waves to produce images of your heart's size, structure and motion.\n    Implantable loop recorder. This device detects abnormal heart rhythms and is implanted under the skin in the chest area.\n\nIf your doctor doesn't find a heart rhythm problem during those tests, you may need other tests, such as:\n\n    Stress test. For some people, supraventricular tachycardia is triggered or worsened by stress or exercise. During a stress test, you'll be asked to exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle while your heart activity is monitored. If you can't exercise and your doctor thinks heart disease may be causing your arrhythmia, you may receive a drug to stimulate your heart in a way that's similar to exercise.\n    Tilt table test. Your doctor may recommend this test if you've had fainting spells. Your heart rate and blood pressure are monitored as you lie flat on a table. The table is then tilted as if you were standing up. Your doctor observes how your heart and the nervous system that controls it respond to the change in angle.\n    \n    Electrophysiological testing and mapping. In this test, doctors thread thin tubes (catheters) tipped with electrodes through your blood vessels to several areas within your heart. Once in place, the electrodes can map the spread of electrical signals through your heart.\n    In addition, your cardiologist can use the electrodes to stimulate your heart to beat at rates that may trigger \u2014 or stop \u2014 the arrhythmia.

You may be able to stop an episode of SVT by using particular movements such as holding your breath and straining as you would during a bowel movement, dunking your face in ice water, or coughing. These maneuvers affect the nervous system that controls your heartbeat (vagus nerves), often causing your heart rate to slow.\n    \n    Cardioversion. If you're unable to stop an episode of SVT on your own using vagal maneuvers, your doctor may use cardioversion. Cardioversion may be done using medications or during a heart procedure.\n    In the procedure, a shock is delivered to your heart through paddles or patches on your chest.

You may need to try various treatments over months or years to control it. And even if treatment is successful, signs and symptoms may return (flare).\nIt's important to recognize the condition early so that you can start treatment. If regular moisturizing and other self-care steps don't help, your doctor may suggest one or more of the following treatments:\n        \n            \n            Medications\n    \n    Creams that control itching and help repair the skin. Your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream or ointment. Apply it as directed, after you moisturize. Overuse of this drug may cause side effects, including thinning skin.\n    Other creams containing drugs called calcineurin inhibitors \u2014 such as tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) \u2014 affect your immune system. They are used by people older than age 2 to help control the skin reaction. Apply it as directed, after you moisturize. Avoid strong sunlight when using these products.\n    These drugs have a black box warning about a potential risk of cancer. But the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology has concluded that the risk-to-benefit ratios of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus are similar to those of most other conventional treatments of persistent eczema and that the data don't support the use of the black box warning.\n    \n    Drugs to fight infection. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic cream if your skin has a bacterial infection, an open sore or cracks. He or she may recommend taking oral antibiotics for a short time to treat an infection.\n    Oral drugs that control inflammation. For more-severe cases, your doctor may prescribe oral corticosteroids \u2014 such as prednisone. These drugs are effective but can't be used long term because of potential serious side effects.\n    Newer option for severe eczema. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved a new, injectable biologic (monoclonal antibody) called dupilumab (Dupixent). It is used to treat people with severe disease who do not respond well to other treatment options. This is a newer medication, so it doesn't have a long track record in terms of how well it helps people. Studies have shown it to be safe if used as directed. It is very expensive.\n\n        \n            \n            Therapies\n    Wet dressings. An effective, intensive treatment for severe atopic dermatitis involves wrapping the affected area with topical corticosteroids and wet bandages. Sometimes this is done in a hospital for people with widespread lesions because it's labor intensive and requires nursing expertise. Or, ask your doctor about learning how to do this technique at home.\n    \n    Light therapy. This treatment is used for people who either don't get better with topical treatments or who rapidly flare again after treatment. The simplest form of light therapy (phototherapy) involves exposing the skin to controlled amounts of natural sunlight. Other forms use artificial ultraviolet A (UVA) and narrow band ultraviolet B (UVB) either alone or with medications.\n    Though effective, long-term light therapy has harmful effects, including premature skin aging and an increased risk of skin cancer. For these reasons, phototherapy is less commonly used in young children and not given to infants. Talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of light therapy.\n    \n    Counseling. Talking with a therapist or other counselor may help people who are embarrassed or frustrated by their skin condition.\n    Relaxation, behavior modification and biofeedback. These approaches may help people who scratch habitually.\n\n        \n            \n            Infant eczemaTreatment for eczema in babies (infantile eczema) includes:\n\n    Identifying and avoiding skin irritants\n    Avoiding extreme temperatures\n    Lubricating your baby's skin with bath oils, creams or ointments\n\nSee your baby's doctor if these measures don't improve the rash or if the rash looks infected. Your baby may need a prescription medication to control the rash or to treat an infection.

It changes your regular pattern of breathing and affects the exchange of lung gases, which can cause the air sacs (alveoli) to deflate. Nearly everyone who has major surgery develops some amount of atelectasis. It often occurs after heart bypass surgery.\nObstructive atelectasis may be caused by many things, including:\n\n    Mucus plug. A mucus plug is a buildup of mucus in your airways. It commonly occurs during and after surgery because you can't cough. Drugs given during surgery make you breathe less deeply, so normal secretions collect in the airways. Suctioning the lungs during surgery helps clear them, but sometimes they still build up. Mucus plugs are also common in children, people with cystic fibrosis and during severe asthma attacks.\n    Foreign body. Atelectasis is common in children who have inhaled an object, such as a peanut or small toy part, into their lungs.\n    Tumor inside the airway. An abnormal growth can narrow the airway.\n\nPossible causes of nonobstructive atelectasis include:\n\n    Injury. Chest trauma \u2014 from a fall or car accident, for example \u2014 can cause you to avoid taking deep breaths (due to the pain), which can result in compression of your lungs.\n    Pleural effusion. This condition involves the buildup of fluid between the tissues (pleura) that line the lungs and the inside of the chest wall.\n    Pneumonia. Various types of pneumonia, a lung infection, can cause atelectasis.\n    Pneumothorax. Air leaks into the space between your lungs and chest wall, indirectly causing some or all of a lung to collapse.\n    Scarring of lung tissue.

Since a CT is a more sensitive technique than an X-ray, it may sometimes help better detect the cause and type of atelectasis.\n    Oximetry. This simple test uses a small device placed on one of your fingers to measure your blood-oxygen level. It helps determine the severity of atelectasis.\n    Ultrasound of the thorax.

Your cerebellum comprises two portions of folded tissue situated at the base of your brain near your brainstem. This area of the brain helps with balance as well as eye movements, swallowing and speech.\nDiseases that damage the spinal cord and peripheral nerves that connect your cerebellum to your muscles also can cause ataxia. Ataxia causes include:\n\n    Head trauma. Damage to your brain or spinal cord from a blow to your head, such as might occur in a car accident, can cause acute cerebellar ataxia, which comes on suddenly.\n    Stroke. Either a blockage or bleeding in the brain can cause ataxia. When the blood supply to a part of your brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients, brain cells die.\n    Cerebral palsy. This is a general term for a group of disorders caused by damage to a child's brain during early development \u2014 before, during or shortly after birth \u2014 that affects the child's ability to coordinate body movements.\n    Autoimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, celiac disease and other autoimmune conditions can cause ataxia.\n    Infections. Ataxia can be an uncommon complication of chickenpox and other viral infections such as HIV and Lyme disease. It might appear in the healing stages of the infection and last for days or weeks. Normally, the ataxia resolves over time.\n    Paraneoplastic syndromes. These are rare, degenerative disorders triggered by your immune system's response to a cancerous tumor (neoplasm), most commonly from lung, ovarian, breast or lymphatic cancer. Ataxia can appear months or years before the cancer is diagnosed.\n    Abnormalities in the brain. An infected area (abscess) in the brain may cause ataxia. A growth on the brain, cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign), can damage the cerebellum.\n    \n    Toxic reaction. Ataxia is a potential side effect of certain medications, especially barbiturates, such as phenobarbital; sedatives, such as benzodiazepines; antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin; and some types of chemotherapy. Vitamin B-6 toxicity also may cause ataxia. These causes are important to identify because the effects are often reversible.\n    Also, some medications you take can cause problems as you age, so you might need to reduce your dose or discontinue the medication.\n    Alcohol and drug intoxication; heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead or mercury; and solvent poisoning, such as from paint thinner, also can cause ataxia.\n    \n    Vitamin E, vitamin B-12 or thiamine deficiency. Not getting enough of these nutrients, because of the inability to absorb enough, alcohol misuse or other reasons, can lead to ataxia.\n    Thyroid problems. Hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism can cause ataxia.\nCOVID-19 infection. This infection may cause ataxia, most commonly in very severe cases.\n\nFor some adults who develop sporadic ataxia, no specific cause can be found. Sporadic ataxia can take a number of forms, including multiple system atrophy, a progressive, degenerative disorder.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Hereditary ataxiasSome types of ataxia and some conditions that cause ataxia are hereditary. If you have one of these conditions, you were born with a defect in a certain gene that makes abnormal proteins.\nThe abnormal proteins hamper the function of nerve cells, primarily in your cerebellum and spinal cord, and cause them to degenerate. As the disease progresses, coordination problems worsen.\nYou can inherit a genetic ataxia from either a dominant gene from one parent (autosomal dominant disorder) or a recessive gene from each parent (autosomal recessive disorder). In the latter case, it's possible neither parent has the disorder (silent mutation), so there might be no obvious family history.\nDifferent gene defects cause different types of ataxia, most of which are progressive. Each type causes poor coordination, but each has specific signs and symptoms.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Autosomal dominant ataxias\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAutosomal dominant inheritance pattern\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAutosomal dominant inheritance pattern\r\n\t\t\t\tIn an autosomal dominant disorder, the mutated gene is a dominant gene located on one of the nonsex chromosomes (autosomes).

A person with an autosomal dominant disorder \u2014 in this case, the father \u2014 has a 50% chance of having an affected child with one mutated gene (dominant gene) and a 50% chance of having an unaffected child with two normal genes (recessive genes).\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese include:\n\n    Spinocerebellar ataxias. Researchers have identified more than 40 autosomal dominant ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow. Cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, but other signs and symptoms, as well as age of onset, differ depending on the specific gene mutation.\n    Episodic ataxia (EA). There are eight recognized types of ataxia that are episodic rather than progressive \u2014 EA1 through EA7, plus late-onset episodic ataxia. EA1 and EA2 are the most common. EA1 involves brief ataxic episodes that may last seconds or minutes. The episodes are triggered by stress, being startled or sudden movement, and often are associated with muscle twitching.\nEA2 involves longer episodes, usually lasting from 30 minutes to six hours, which also are triggered by stress. You might have dizziness (vertigo), fatigue and muscle weakness during your episodes. In some cases, symptoms resolve in later life.\nEpisodic ataxia doesn't shorten life span, and symptoms might respond to medication.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Autosomal recessive ataxias\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAutosomal recessive inheritance pattern\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAutosomal recessive inheritance pattern\r\n\t\t\t\tTo have an autosomal recessive disorder, you inherit two mutated genes, one from each parent. These disorders are usually passed on by two carriers. Their health is rarely affected, but they have one mutated gene (recessive gene) and one normal gene (dominant gene) for the condition. Two carriers have a 25% chance of having an unaffected child with two normal genes (left), a 50% chance of having an unaffected child who also is a carrier (middle), and a 25% chance of having an affected child with two recessive genes (right).\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese include:\n\n    \n    Friedreich's ataxia. This common hereditary ataxia involves damage to your cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves carry signals from your brain and spinal cord to your muscles. In most cases, signs and symptoms appear well before age 25.\n    The rate of disease progression varies. The first indication generally is difficulty walking (gait ataxia). The condition typically progresses to the arms and trunk. Muscles weaken and waste away over time, causing deformities, particularly in your feet, lower legs and hands.\n    Other signs and symptoms that might develop as the disease progresses include slow, slurred speech (dysarthria); fatigue; rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); spinal curvature (scoliosis); hearing loss; and heart disease, including heart enlargement (cardiomyopathy) and heart failure. Early treatment of heart problems can improve quality of life and survival.\n    \n    \n    Ataxia-telangiectasia. This rare, progressive childhood disease causes degeneration in the brain and other body systems. The disease also causes immune system breakdown (immunodeficiency disease), which increases susceptibility to other diseases, including infections and tumors. It affects various organs.\n    Telangiectasia is the formation of tiny red \"spider\" veins that might appear in the corners of your child's eyes or on the ears and cheeks. Delayed motor skill development, poor balance and slurred speech are typically the first indications of the disease. Recurrent sinus and respiratory infections are common.\n    Children with ataxia-telangiectasia are at high risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia or lymphoma. Most people with the disease need a wheelchair by their teens and die before age 30, usually of cancer or lung (pulmonary) disease.\n    \n    Congenital cerebellar ataxia. This type of ataxia results from damage to the cerebellum that's present at birth.\n    Wilson's disease. People with this condition accumulate copper in their brains, livers and other organs, which can cause neurological problems, including ataxia.

This makes your vision blurry because there are two image points.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour eye has two structures with curved surfaces that bend (refract) light onto the retina, which makes the images:\n\n    The cornea, the clear front surface of your eye along with the tear film\n    The lens, a clear structure inside your eye that changes shape to help focus on near objects\n\nIn a perfectly shaped eye, each of these elements has a round curvature, like the surface of a smooth ball. A cornea and lens with such curvature bend (refract) all incoming light equally to make a sharply focused image directly on the retina, at the back of your eye.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            A refractive errorIf either your cornea or lens is egg shaped with two mismatched curves, light rays aren't bent the same, which forms two different images. These two images overlap or combine and result in blurred vision. Astigmatism is a type of refractive error.\nAstigmatism occurs when your cornea or lens is curved more steeply in one direction than in another. You have corneal astigmatism if your cornea has mismatched curves. You have lenticular astigmatism if your lens has mismatched curves.\nEither type of astigmatism can cause blurred vision. Blurred vision may occur more in one direction, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.\nAstigmatism may be present from birth, or it may develop after an eye injury, disease or surgery. Astigmatism isn't caused or made worse by reading in poor light, sitting too close to the television or squinting.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Other refractive errorsAstigmatism may occur in combination with other refractive errors, which include:\n\n    Nearsightedness (myopia). This occurs when your cornea is curved too much or your eye is longer than normal. Instead of being focused precisely on your retina, light is focused in front of your retina, making distant objects seem blurry.\n    Farsightedness (hyperopia). This occurs when your cornea is curved too little or your eye is shorter than normal. The effect is the opposite of nearsightedness. When your eye is in a relaxed state, light never comes to a focus on the back of your eye, making nearby objects seem blurry.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    By Mayo Clinic Staff\r\n\r\nRequest an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\nDiagnosis & treatment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sept. 04, 2019\r\n\r\nPrint\r\n\r\n\r\n Share on: FacebookTwitter\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow references\n    What is astigmatism?

A complete eye exam involves a series of tests to check your eye health and a refraction, which determines how your eyes bend light. Your eye doctor may use various instruments, aim bright lights directly at your eyes and ask you to look through several lenses. Your doctor uses these tests to examine different aspects of your eyes and vision and to determine the prescription needed to provide clear vision with eyeglasses or contact lenses.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "The goal of treating astigmatism is to improve vision clarity and eye comfort. Treatments are corrective lenses or refractive surgery.\n        \n            \n            Corrective lensesWearing corrective lenses treats astigmatism by counteracting uneven curvatures of your cornea and lens.\nTypes of corrective lenses include:\n\n    Eyeglasses. Eyeglasses are made with lenses that help compensate for the uneven shape of your eye. The lenses make the light bend into your eye properly. Eyeglasses can also correct for other refractive errors, such as nearsightedness or farsightedness.\n    \n    Contact lenses. Like eyeglasses, contact lenses can correct most astigmatism. They are available in a variety of types and styles, including disposable soft; extended wear; rigid, gas permeable; and bifocal.\n    Contact lenses are also used in a procedure called orthokeratology. In orthokeratology, you wear rigid contact lenses during the night while sleeping until the curvature of your eye evens out. Then you wear the lenses less frequently to maintain the new shape. If you discontinue this treatment, your eyes return to their former shape and refractive error.\n    Wearing contact lenses for extended periods of time increases the risk of infection in the eye.\n    Ask your eye doctor about the pros and cons and risks of contact lenses and what might be best for you.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Refractive surgeryRefractive surgery improves vision and reduces the need for eyeglasses or contact lenses. Your eye surgeon uses a laser beam to reshape the curves of the cornea, which corrects the refractive error. Before surgery, doctors will evaluate you and determine if you're a candidate for refractive surgery.\nTypes of refractive surgery for astigmatism include:\n\n    Laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK). With this procedure, your eye surgeon makes a thin, hinged flap in your cornea. He or she uses an excimer laser to sculpt the shape of the cornea and then repositions the flap.\n    Laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK). Instead of creating a flap in the cornea, the surgeon loosens the cornea's thin protective cover (epithelium) with a special alcohol. He or she uses an excimer laser to change the curvature of the cornea and then repositions the loosened epithelium.\n    Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). This procedure is similar to LASEK, except the surgeon removes the epithelium. It will grow back naturally, conforming to your cornea's new shape. You may need to wear a bandage contact lens for a few days after surgery.\n    Epi-LASIK. This is a variation of LASEK. Your doctor uses a special mechanized blunt blade \u2014 instead of the alcohol \u2014 to separate a very thin sheet of epithelium. He or she then uses an excimer laser to reshape the cornea and repositions the epithelium.\n    Small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). This newer type of refractive surgery reshapes the cornea by using a laser to make a lens-shaped bit of tissue (lenticule) below the cornea surface. The lenticule is then removed through a very small incision. For now, the SMILE procedure is only approved for treating mild nearsightedness.\n\nOther types of refractive surgeries include clear lens extraction and implantable contact lenses. There is no one best method for refractive surgery, and the decision should only be made after a complete evaluation and thorough discussion with your surgeon.\nSome of the possible complications that can occur after refractive surgery include:\n\n    Undercorrection or overcorrection of your initial problem\n    Visual side effects, such as a halo or starburst appearing around lights\n    Dry eye\n    Infection\n    Corneal scarring\n    Rarely, vision loss\n\nDiscuss the potential risks and benefits of these procedures with your eye doctor.More InformationLASIK eye surgery\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Your child might have only one indication, such as a lingering cough or chest congestion.\nIt can be difficult to tell whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma. Periodic or long-lasting wheezing and other asthma-like symptoms can be caused by infectious bronchitis or another respiratory problem.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorTake your child to see the doctor if you suspect he or she has asthma.

Crying, laughing, yelling, or strong emotional reactions and stress also might trigger coughing or wheezing.\nIf your child is diagnosed with asthma, creating an asthma plan can help you and other caregivers monitor symptoms and know what to do if an asthma attack occurs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to seek emergency treatmentIn severe cases, you might see your child's chest and sides pulling inward as he or she struggles to breathe. Your child might have an increased heartbeat, sweating and chest pain. Seek emergency care if your child:\n\n    Has to stop in midsentence to catch his or her breath\n    Is using abdominal muscles to breathe\n    Has widened nostrils when breathing in\n    Is trying so hard to breathe that the abdomen is sucked under the ribs when he or she breathes in\n\nEven if your child hasn't been diagnosed with asthma, seek medical attention immediately if he or she has trouble breathing.

Some factors thought to be involved include:\n\n    Inherited tendency to develop allergies\n    Parents with asthma\n    Some types of airway infections at a very young age\n    Exposure to environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke or other air pollution\n\nIncreased immune system sensitivity causes the lungs and airways to swell and produce mucus when exposed to certain triggers. Reaction to a trigger can be delayed, making it more difficult to identify the trigger. Triggers vary from child to child and can include:\n\n    Viral infections such as the common cold\n    Exposure to air pollutants, such as tobacco smoke\n    Allergies to dust mites, pet dander, pollen or mold\n    Physical activity\n    Weather changes or cold air\n\nSometimes, asthma symptoms occur with no apparent triggers.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Asthma can be hard to diagnose. Your child's doctor will consider the symptoms and their frequency and your child's medical history. Your child might need tests to rule out other conditions and to identify the most likely cause of the symptoms.\nA number of childhood conditions can have symptoms similar to those caused by asthma. To complicate the issue further, these conditions also commonly occur with asthma. So your child's doctor will have to determine whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma, a condition other than asthma, or both asthma and another condition.\nConditions that can cause asthma-like symptoms include:\n\n    Rhinitis\n    Sinusitis\n    Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n    Airway abnormalities\n    Dysfunctional breathing\n    Respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\n\t\nThe following are tests your child might need.\n\n    Lung function tests (spirometry). Doctors diagnose asthma with the same tests used to identify the disease in adults. Spirometry measures how much air your child can exhale and how quickly. Your child might have lung function tests at rest, after exercising and after taking asthma medication.\n    Another lung function test is brochoprovocation. Using spirometry, this test measures how your lungs react to certain provocations, such as exercise or exposure to cold air.\n    Exhaled nitric oxide test. If the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain after lung function tests, your doctor might recommend measuring the level of nitric oxide in an exhaled sample of your child's breath. Nitric oxide testing can also help determine whether steroid medications might be helpful for your child's asthma.\n\nThe asthma tests used, however, aren't accurate before 5 years of age. For younger children, your doctor will rely on information you and your child provide about symptoms. Sometimes a diagnosis can't be made until later, after months or even years of observing symptoms.\n        \n            \n            Allergy tests for allergic asthmaIf your child seems to have asthma that's triggered by allergies, the doctor might recommend allergy skin testing. During a skin test, the skin is pricked with extracts of common allergy-causing substances, such as animal dander, mold or dust mites, and observed for signs of an allergic reaction.More InformationWill my child outgrow asthma?\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Initial treatment depends on the severity of your child's asthma. The goal of asthma treatment is to keep symptoms under control, meaning that your child has:\n\n    Minimal or no symptoms\n    Few or no asthma flare-ups\n    No limitations on physical activities or exercise\n    Minimal use of quick-relief (rescue) inhalers, such as albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\n    Few or no side effects from medications\n\nTreating asthma involves both preventing symptoms and treating an asthma attack in progress. The right medication for your child depends on a number of things, including age, symptoms, asthma triggers and what seems to work best to keep his or her asthma under control.\nFor children younger than age 3 who have mild symptoms of asthma, the doctor might use a wait-and-see approach. This is because the long-term effects of asthma medication on infants and young children aren't clear.\nHowever, if an infant or toddler has frequent or severe wheezing episodes, a medication might be prescribed to see if it improves symptoms.\n        \n            \n            Long-term control medicationsPreventive, long-term control medications reduce the inflammation in your child's airways that leads to symptoms. In most cases, these medications need to be taken daily.\nTypes of long-term control medications include:\n\n    Inhaled corticosteroids. These medications include fluticasone (Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), mometasone (Asmanex HFA), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar Redihaler) and others. Your child might need to use these medications for several days to weeks before getting the full benefit.\nLong-term use of these medications has been associated with slightly slowed growth in children, but the effect is minor. In most cases, the benefits of good asthma control outweigh the risks of possible side effects.\n    Leukotriene modifiers. These oral medications include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo). They help prevent asthma symptoms for up to 24 hours.\n    Combination inhalers. These medications contain an inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta agonist (LABA). They include fluticasone and salmeterol (Advair Diskus, Advair HFA), budesonide and formoterol (Symbicort), fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta), and mometasone and formoterol (Dulera).\nIn some situations, long-acting beta agonists have been linked to severe asthma attacks. For this reason, LABA medications should always be given to a child with an inhaler that also contains a corticosteroid. These combination inhalers should be used only for asthma that's not well-controlled by other medications.\n    Theophylline. This is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open. Theophylline (Theo-24) relaxes the muscles around the airways to make breathing easier. It's mostly used with inhaled steroids. If you take this drug, you'll need to have your blood checked regularly.\n    Immunomodulatory agents. Mepolizumab (Nucala), dupilumab (Dupixent) and benralizumab (Fasenra) might be appropriate for children over the age of 12 who have severe eosinophilic asthma. Omalizumab (Xolair) can be considered for children age 6 or older who have moderate to severe allergic asthma.\n\n        \n            \n            Quick-relief medicationsQuick-relief medications quickly open swollen airways. Also called rescue medications, quick-relief medications are used as needed for rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack \u2014 or before exercise if your child's doctor recommends it.\nTypes of quick-relief medications include:\n\n    Short-acting beta agonists. These inhaled bronchodilator medications can rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA). These medications act within minutes, and effects last several hours.\n    Oral and intravenous corticosteroids. These medications relieve airway inflammation caused by severe asthma. Examples include prednisone and methylprednisolone. They can cause serious side effects when used long term, so they're only used to treat severe asthma symptoms on a short-term basis.\n\n        \n            \n            Treatment for allergy-induced asthmaIf your child's asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies, your child might benefit from allergy treatment, such as the following, as well:\n\n    Omalizumab (Xolair). This medication is for people who have allergies and severe asthma. It reduces the immune system's reaction to allergy-causing substances, such as pollen, dust mites and pet dander. Xolair is delivered by injection every two to four weeks.\n    Allergy medications. These include oral and nasal spray antihistamines and decongestants as well as corticosteroid, cromolyn and ipratropium nasal sprays.\n    Allergy shots (immunotherapy). Immunotherapy injections are generally given once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years. Over time, they gradually reduce your child's immune system reaction to specific allergens.\n\n        \n            \n            Don't rely only on quick-relief medicationsLong-term asthma control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. These medications keep asthma under control and make it less likely that your child will have an asthma attack.\nIf your child does have an asthma flare-up, a quick-relief (rescue) inhaler can ease symptoms right away. But if long-term control medications are working properly, your child shouldn't need to use a quick-relief inhaler very often.\nKeep a record of how many puffs your child uses each week. If he or she frequently needs to use a quick-relief inhaler, take your child to see the doctor. You probably need to adjust the long-term control medication.\n        \n            \n            Inhaled medication devicesInhaled short- and long-term control medications are used by inhaling a measured dose of medication.\n\n    Older children and teens might use a small, hand-held device called a pressurized metered dose inhaler or an inhaler that releases a fine powder.\n    Infants and toddlers need to use a face mask attached to a metered dose inhaler or a nebulizer to get the correct amount of medication.\n    Babies need to a use a device that turns liquid medication into fine droplets (nebulizer). Your baby wears a face mask and breathes normally while the nebulizer delivers the correct dose of medication.\n\n        \n            \n            Asthma action planWork with your child's doctor to create a written asthma action plan. This can be an important part of treatment, especially if your child has severe asthma. An asthma action plan can help you and your child:\n\n    Recognize when you need to adjust long-term control medications\n    Determine how well treatment is working\n    Identify the signs of an asthma attack and know what to do when one occurs\n    Know when to call a doctor or seek emergency help\n\nChildren who have enough coordination and understanding might use a hand-held device to measure how well they can breathe (peak flow meter). A written asthma action plan can help you and your child remember what to do when peak flow measurements reach a certain level.\nThe action plan might use peak flow measurements and symptoms to categorize your child's asthma into zones, such as the green zone, yellow zone and red zone. These zones correspond to well-controlled symptoms, somewhat-controlled symptoms and poorly controlled symptoms. This makes tracking your child's asthma easier.\nYour child's symptoms and triggers are likely to change over time. You'll need to observe symptoms and work with the doctor to adjust medications as needed.\nIf your child's symptoms are completely controlled for a time, your child's doctor might recommend lowering doses or stopping asthma medications (step-down treatment). If your child's asthma isn't as well-controlled, the doctor might want to increase, change or add medications (step-up treatment).More InformationAsthma in children under 5Treating asthma in children age 12 and olderTreating asthma in children ages 5 to 11\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Your doctor will give you instructions on how to track and deal with low peak flow readings.\n\nLung function tests often are done before and after taking a medication to open your airways called a bronchodilator (brong-koh-DIE-lay-tur), such as albuterol. If your lung function improves with use of a bronchodilator, it's likely you have asthma.\n        \n            \n            Additional testsOther tests to diagnose asthma include:\n\n    Methacholine challenge. Methacholine is a known asthma trigger. When inhaled, it will cause your airways to narrow slightly. If you react to the methacholine, you likely have asthma. This test may be used even if your initial lung function test is normal.\n    Imaging tests. A chest X-ray can help identify any structural abnormalities or diseases (such as infection) that can cause or aggravate breathing problems.\n    Allergy testing. Allergy tests can be performed by a skin test or blood test. They tell you if you're allergic to pets, dust, mold or pollen. If allergy triggers are identified, your doctor may recommend allergy shots.\n    Nitric oxide test. This test measures the amount of the gas nitric oxide in your breath. When your airways are inflamed \u2014 a sign of asthma \u2014 you may have higher than normal nitric oxide levels. This test isn't widely available.\n    Sputum eosinophils. This test looks for certain white blood cells (eosinophils) in the mixture of saliva and mucus (sputum) you discharge during coughing. Eosinophils are present when symptoms develop and become visible when stained with a rose-colored dye.\n    Provocative testing for exercise and cold-induced asthma. In these tests, your doctor measures your airway obstruction before and after you perform vigorous physical activity or take several breaths of cold air.\n\n        \n            \n            How asthma is classifiedTo classify your asthma severity, your doctor will consider how often you have signs and symptoms and how severe they are. Your doctor will also consider the results of your physical exam and diagnostic tests.\nDetermining your asthma severity helps your doctor choose the best treatment. Asthma severity often changes over time, requiring treatment adjustments.\nAsthma is classified into four general categories:\n\n    \n        \n            Asthma classification\n            Signs and symptoms\n        \n        \n            Mild intermittent\n            Mild symptoms up to two days a week and up to two nights a month\n        \n        \n            Mild persistent\n            Symptoms more than twice a week, but no more than once in a single day\n        \n        \n            Moderate persistent\n            Symptoms once a day and more than one night a week\n        \n        \n            Severe persistent\n            Symptoms throughout the day on most days and frequently at night\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your asthma-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationAsthma care at Mayo ClinicAsthma: Testing and diagnosisReactive airway disease: Is it asthma?CT scanNitric oxide test for asthmaPeak flow meterSpirometryX-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Prevention and long-term control are key to stopping asthma attacks before they start. Treatment usually involves learning to recognize your triggers, taking steps to avoid triggers and tracking your breathing to make sure your medications are keeping symptoms under control. In case of an asthma flare-up, you may need to use a quick-relief inhaler.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsThe right medications for you depend on a number of things \u2014 your age, symptoms, asthma triggers and what works best to keep your asthma under control.\nPreventive, long-term control medications reduce the swelling (inflammation) in your airways that leads to symptoms. Quick-relief inhalers (bronchodilators) quickly open swollen airways that are limiting breathing. In some cases, allergy medications are necessary.\nLong-term asthma control medications, generally taken daily, are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. These medications keep asthma under control on a day-to-day basis and make it less likely you'll have an asthma attack. Types of long-term control medications include:\n\n    \n    Inhaled corticosteroids. These medications include fluticasone propionate (Flovent HFA, Flovent Diskus, Xhance), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Pulmicort Respules, Rhinocort), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar Redihaler), mometasone (Asmanex HFA, Asmanex Twisthaler) and fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta).\n    You may need to use these medications for several days to weeks before they reach their maximum benefit. Unlike oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids have a relatively low risk of serious side effects.\n    \n    \n    Leukotriene modifiers. These oral medications \u2014 including montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo) \u2014 help relieve asthma symptoms.\n    Montelukast has been linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if you experience any of these reactions.\n    \n    Combination inhalers. These medications \u2014 such as fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair HFA, Airduo Digihaler, others), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), formoterol-mometasone (Dulera) and fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (Breo Ellipta) \u2014 contain a long-acting beta agonist along with a corticosteroid.\n    Theophylline. Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin, Theochron) is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open by relaxing the muscles around the airways. It's not used as often as other asthma medications and requires regular blood tests.\n\nQuick-relief (rescue) medications are used as needed for rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack. They may also be used before exercise if your doctor recommends it. Types of quick-relief medications include:\n\n    \n    Short-acting beta agonists. These inhaled, quick-relief bronchodilators act within minutes to rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and levalbuterol (Xopenex, Xopenex HFA).\n    Short-acting beta agonists can be taken using a portable, hand-held inhaler or a nebulizer, a machine that converts asthma medications to a fine mist. They're inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.\n    \n    Anticholinergic agents. Like other bronchodilators, ipratropium (Atrovent HFA) and tiotropium (Spiriva, Spiriva Respimat) act quickly to immediately relax your airways, making it easier to breathe. They're mostly used for emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but can be used to treat asthma.\n    Oral and intravenous corticosteroids. These medications \u2014 which include prednisone (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) and methylprednisolone (Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol) \u2014 relieve airway inflammation caused by severe asthma. They can cause serious side effects when used long term, so these drugs are used only on a short-term basis to treat severe asthma symptoms.\n\nIf you have an asthma flare-up, a quick-relief inhaler can ease your symptoms right away. But you shouldn't need to use your quick-relief inhaler very often if your long-term control medications are working properly.\nKeep a record of how many puffs you use each week. If you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often than your doctor recommends, see your doctor. You probably need to adjust your long-term control medication.\nAllergy medications may help if your asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies. These include:\n\n    Allergy shots (immunotherapy). Over time, allergy shots gradually reduce your immune system reaction to specific allergens. You generally receive shots once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years.\n    Biologics. These medications \u2014 which include omalizumab (Xolair), mepolizumab (Nucala), dupilumab (Dupixent), reslizumab (Cinqair) and benralizumab (Fasenra) \u2014 are specifically for people who have severe asthma.\n\n        \n            \n            Bronchial thermoplastyThis treatment is used for severe asthma that doesn't improve with inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term asthma medications. It isn't widely available nor right for everyone.\nDuring bronchial thermoplasty, your doctor heats the insides of the airways in the lungs with an electrode. The heat reduces the smooth muscle inside the airways. This limits the ability of the airways to tighten, making breathing easier and possibly reducing asthma attacks. The therapy is generally done over three outpatient visits.\n        \n            \n            Treat by severity for better control: A stepwise approachYour treatment should be flexible and based on changes in your symptoms. Your doctor should ask about your symptoms at each visit. Based on your signs and symptoms, your doctor can adjust your treatment accordingly.\nFor example, if your asthma is well controlled, your doctor may prescribe less medication. If your asthma isn't well controlled or is getting worse, your doctor may increase your medication and recommend more-frequent visits.\n        \n            \n            Asthma action planWork with your doctor to create an asthma action plan that outlines in writing when to take certain medications or when to increase or decrease the dose of your medications based on your symptoms. Also include a list of your triggers and the steps you need to take to avoid them.\nYour doctor may also recommend tracking your asthma symptoms or using a peak flow meter on a regular basis to monitor how well your treatment is controlling your asthma.More InformationAsthma care at Mayo ClinicAsthma inhalers: Which one's right for you?Asthma medicationsAsthma treatment: 3 stepsLABAs for asthmaAllergy shotsDry powder disk inhalerDry powder tube inhalerSingle-dose dry powder inhalerUsing a metered dose asthma inhaler and spacerShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Outdoors, it's found in decaying leaves and compost and on plants, trees and grain crops.\nEveryday exposure to aspergillus is rarely a problem for people with healthy immune systems. When mold spores are inhaled, immune system cells surround and destroy them. But people who have a weakened immune system from illness or immunosuppressant medications have fewer infection-fighting cells. This allows aspergillus to take hold, invading the lungs and, in the most serious cases, other parts of the body.\nAspergillosis is not contagious from person to person.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing an aspergilloma or invasive aspergillosis can be difficult. Aspergillus is common in all environments but difficult to distinguish from certain other molds under the microscope.

A chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan \u2014 a type of X-ray that produces more-detailed images than conventional X-rays do \u2014 can usually reveal a fungal mass (aspergilloma), as well as characteristic signs of invasive aspergillosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\n    Respiratory secretion (sputum) test. In this test, a sample of your sputum is stained with a dye and checked for the presence of aspergillus filaments. The specimen is then placed in a culture that encourages the mold to grow to help confirm the diagnosis.\n    Tissue and blood tests. Skin testing, as well as sputum and blood tests, may be helpful in confirming allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. For the skin test, a small amount of aspergillus antigen is injected into the skin of your forearm. If your blood has antibodies to the mold, you'll develop a hard, red bump at the injection site. Blood tests look for high levels of certain antibodies, indicating an allergic response.\n    Biopsy.

Instead, aspergillomas that don't cause symptoms may simply be closely monitored by chest X-ray. If the condition progresses, then antifungal medications may be recommended.\n    Oral corticosteroids. The goal in treating allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is to prevent existing asthma or cystic fibrosis from worsening. The best way to do this is with oral corticosteroids. Antifungal medications by themselves aren't helpful for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, but they may be combined with corticosteroids to reduce the dose of steroids and improve lung function.\n    \n    Antifungal medications.

RSV is a common virus that infects just about every child by 2 years of age. Outbreaks of RSV infection occur every winter, and individuals can be reinfected, as previous infection does not appear to cause lasting immunity. Bronchiolitis also can be caused by other viruses, including those that cause the flu or the common cold.\nThe viruses that cause bronchiolitis are easily spread.

But they can also occur with normal use of a bone that's been weakened by a condition such as osteoporosis.\r\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During the physical exam, the doctor will inspect the affected area for tenderness, swelling, deformity or an open wound.\nX-rays usually can pinpoint the location of the break and determine the extent of injury to any adjacent joints.

Stress fractures may require only rest and immobilization. Fractures are classified into one or more of the following categories:\n\n    Open (compound) fracture. In this type of fracture, the skin is pierced by the broken bone. This is a serious condition that requires immediate, aggressive treatment to decrease your chance of an infection.\n    Closed fracture. In closed fractures, the surrounding skin remains intact.\n    Incomplete fracture. This term means that the bone is cracked, but it isn't separated into two parts.\n    Complete fracture. In complete fractures, the bone has snapped into two or more parts.\n    Displaced fracture. In this type of fracture, the bone fragments on each side of the break are not aligned. A displaced fracture may require surgery to realign the bones properly.\n    Greenstick fracture. In this type of fracture, the bone cracks but doesn't break all the way through \u2014 like when you try to break a green stick of wood. Most broken bones in children are greenstick fractures, because a child's bones are softer and more flexible than those of an adult.\n\n        \n            \n            Setting the legInitial treatment for a broken leg usually begins in an emergency room or urgent care clinic. Here, doctors typically evaluate your injury and immobilize your leg with a splint. If you have a displaced fracture, your doctor may need to manipulate the pieces back into their proper positions before applying a splint \u2014 a process called reduction. Some fractures are splinted for a day to allow swelling to subside before they are casted.\n        \n            \n            ImmobilizationRestricting the movement of a broken bone in your leg is critical to proper healing. To do this, you may need a splint or a cast. And you may need to use crutches or a cane to keep weight off the affected leg for six to eight weeks or longer.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsTo reduce pain and inflammation, your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or a combination of the two. If you're experiencing severe pain, your doctor might prescribe stronger pain medications.\n        \n            \n            TherapyAfter your cast or splint is removed, you'll likely need rehabilitation exercises or physical therapy to reduce stiffness and restore movement in the injured leg. Because you haven't moved your leg for a while, you may even have stiffness and weakened muscles in uninjured areas. Rehabilitation can help, but it may take up to several months \u2014 or even longer \u2014 for complete healing of severe injuries.\n        \n            \n            Surgical and other proceduresImmobilization heals most broken bones. However, you may need surgery to implant internal fixation devices, such as plates, rods or screws, to maintain proper position of your bones during healing. These internal fixation devices may be necessary if you have the following injuries:\n\n    Multiple fractures\n    An unstable or displaced fracture\n    Loose bone fragments that could enter a joint\n    Damage to the surrounding ligaments\n    Fractures that extend into a joint\n    A fracture that is the result of a crushing accident\n    A fracture in particular areas of your leg, such as your thighbone\n\nFor some injuries, your doctor may also recommend an external fixation device \u2014 a frame outside your leg attached to the bone with pins. This device provides stability during the healing process and is usually removed after about six to eight weeks. There's a risk of infection around the surgical pins connected to the external fixation device.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Arthritis that involves the cartilage in the chest, also known as costochondritis, can also cause pain.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorMake an appointment with your doctor if breast pain:\n\n    Continues daily for more than a couple of weeks\n    Occurs in one specific area of your breast\n    Seems to be getting worse over time\n    Interferes with daily activities\n    Awakens you from sleep\n\nBreast cancer risk is very low in people whose main symptom is breast pain, but if your doctor recommends an evaluation, it's important to follow through.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Changing hormone levels can cause changes in the milk ducts or milk glands.

Your doctor checks for changes in your breasts, examining your breasts and the lymph nodes in your lower neck and underarm. Your doctor will likely listen to your heart and lungs and check your chest and abdomen to determine whether the pain could be related to another condition. If your medical history and the breast and physical exam reveal nothing unusual, you may not need additional tests.\n    Mammogram. If your doctor feels a breast lump or unusual thickening, or detects a focused area of pain in your breast tissue, you'll need an X-ray exam of your breast that evaluates the area of concern found during the breast exam (diagnostic mammogram).\n    Ultrasound. An ultrasound exam uses sound waves to produce images of your breasts, and it's often done along with a mammogram. You might need an ultrasound to evaluate a focused area of pain even if the mammogram appears normal.\n    Breast biopsy. Suspicious breast lumps, areas of thickening or unusual areas seen during imaging exams may require a biopsy before your doctor can make a diagnosis. During a biopsy, your doctor obtains a small sample of breast tissue from the area in question and sends it for lab analysis.\nMore InformationBreast biopsyBreast self-exam for breast awarenessMammogramUltrasoundShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "For many people, breast pain resolves on its own over time. You may not need any treatment.\nIf you do need help managing your pain or if you need treatment, your doctor might recommend that you:\n\n    Eliminate an underlying cause or aggravating factor. This may involve a simple adjustment, such as wearing a bra with extra support.\n    Use a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication. You may need to use NSAIDs when your pain is intense. Your doctor may recommend that you apply an NSAID cream directly to the area where you feel pain.\n    Adjust birth control pills. If you take birth control pills, skipping the pill-free week or switching birth control methods may help breast pain symptoms. But don't try this without your doctor's advice.\n    Reduce the dose of menopausal hormone therapy. You might consider lowering the dose of menopausal hormone therapy or stopping it entirely.\n    Take a prescription medication. Danazol is the only prescription medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating fibrocystic breasts. However, danazol carries the risk of potentially severe side effects, such as heart and liver problems, as well as weight gain and voice changes. Tamoxifen, a prescription medication for breast cancer treatment and prevention, may help, but this drug also carries the potential for side effects that may be more bothersome than the breast pain itself.\nMore InformationCombination birth control pills\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Each lobule holds tiny, hollow sacs (alveoli). The lobules are linked by a network of thin tubes (ducts). If you're breast-feeding, ducts carry milk from the alveoli toward the dark area of skin in the center of the breast (areola). From the areola, the ducts join together into larger ducts ending at the nipple.\r\n                \r\n                \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n                \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                \r\n                    Fat, ligaments and connective tissue\r\n                    Spaces around the lobules and ducts are filled with fat, ligaments and connective tissue. The amount of fat in your breasts largely determines their size. The actual milk-producing structures are nearly the same in all women. Female breast tissue is sensitive to cyclic changes in hormone levels. Most women's breast tissue changes as they age, with more fat relative to the amount of dense tissue.\n\r\n                \r\n                \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n                \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                \r\n                    Muscles\r\n                    The breast has no muscle tissue.

Also see your doctor if you have new skin changes on one or both of your breasts.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Each of your breasts contains lobes of glandular tissue, arranged like petals of a daisy. The lobes are divided into smaller lobules that produce milk during pregnancy and breast-feeding. The supporting tissue that gives the breast its shape is made up of fatty tissue and fibrous connective tissue. Breast cysts develop as a result of fluid accumulation inside the glands in the breasts.\nBreast cysts may be defined by their size:\n\n    Microcysts may be seen during imaging tests, such as mammography or ultrasound, but are too small to feel.\n    Macrocysts are large enough to be felt and can grow to about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nExperts don't know exactly what causes breast cysts. They may develop as a result of hormonal changes from monthly menstruation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

Ultrasound \u2014 a procedure that uses sound waves to create images of your breast on a monitor \u2014 might be used to help place the needle.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nDiagnosis of a breast cyst usually includes a breast exam; imaging tests, such as a breast ultrasound or mammogram; and possibly fine-needle aspiration or a breast biopsy.\n        \n            \n            Breast examAfter discussing your symptoms and health history, your doctor will physically examine the breast lump and check for any other breast abnormalities. Because your doctor can't tell from a clinical breast exam alone whether a breast lump is a cyst, you'll need another test. This is usually either an imaging test or fine-needle aspiration.\n        \n            \n            Imaging testsNeeded tests may include:\n\n    Mammography. Large cysts and clusters of small cysts can usually be seen with mammography. But microcysts can be difficult or impossible to see on a mammogram.\n    Breast ultrasound. This test can help your doctor determine whether a breast lump is fluid filled or solid. A fluid-filled area usually indicates a breast cyst. A solid-appearing mass most likely is a noncancerous lump, such as a fibroadenoma, but solid lumps also could be breast cancer. \n\nYour doctor may recommend a biopsy to further evaluate a mass that appears solid. If your doctor can easily feel a breast lump, he or she may skip imaging tests and perform fine-needle aspiration to drain the fluid and collapse the cyst.\n        \n            \n            Fine-needle aspirationDuring a fine-needle aspiration, your doctor inserts a thin needle into the breast lump and attempts to withdraw (aspirate) fluid. Often, fine-needle aspiration is done using ultrasound to guide accurate placement of the needle. If fluid comes out and the breast lump goes away, your doctor can make a breast cyst diagnosis immediately.\n\n    If the fluid is not bloody and has a straw-colored appearance and the breast lump disappears, you need no further testing or treatment.\n    If the fluid appears bloody or the breast lump doesn't disappear, your doctor may send a sample of the fluid for lab testing and refer you to a breast surgeon or to a radiologist \u2014 a doctor trained to perform imaging exams and procedures \u2014 for follow-up.\n    If no fluid is withdrawn, your doctor will likely recommend an imaging test, such as a diagnostic mammogram or ultrasound. The lack of fluid or a breast lump that doesn't disappear after aspiration suggests that the breast lump \u2014 or at least a portion of it \u2014 is solid. A sample of the tissue may be collected to check for cancer.\nMore InformationBreast biopsyBreast self-exam for breast awarenessMammogramNeedle biopsyShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "No treatment is necessary for simple breast cysts \u2014 those that are fluid filled and don't cause any symptoms \u2014 that are confirmed on breast ultrasound or after a fine-needle aspiration. Many cysts will disappear with no treatment. If a cyst persists, feels firmer or you notice skin changes on the skin over the cyst, follow up with your doctor.\n        \n            \n             Fine-needle aspirationFine-needle aspiration may be used to diagnose and treat a breast cyst if all the fluid can be removed from the cyst during the procedure, and then your breast lump disappears and your symptoms resolve.\nFor some breast cysts, however, you may need to have fluid drained more than once. Recurrent or new cysts are common. If a breast cyst persists through two to three menstrual cycles and grows larger, see your doctor for further evaluation.\n        \n            \n            Hormone useUsing birth control pills (oral contraceptives) to regulate your menstrual cycles may help reduce the recurrence of breast cysts. But because of possible significant side effects, birth control pills or other hormone therapy, such as tamoxifen, is usually recommended only for women with severe symptoms. Discontinuing hormone therapy after menopause may also help prevent breast cysts.\n        \n            \n            SurgerySurgery to remove a breast cyst is necessary only in unusual circumstances. Surgery may be considered if an uncomfortable breast cyst recurs month after month or if a breast cyst contains blood-tinged fluid or shows other worrisome signs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

The accumulating cells form a tumor that may spread (metastasize) to nearby tissue, to the lymph nodes or to other parts of the body.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Where breast cancer begins in menEveryone is born with a small amount of breast tissue. Breast tissue consists of milk-producing glands (lobules), ducts that carry milk to the nipples, and fat.\nDuring puberty, women begin developing more breast tissue, and men do not. But because men are born with a small amount of breast tissue, they can develop breast cancer.\nTypes of breast cancer diagnosed in men include:\n\n    Cancer that begins in the milk ducts (ductal carcinoma). Nearly all male breast cancer is ductal carcinoma.\n    Cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands (lobular carcinoma). This type is rare in men because they have few lobules in their breast tissue.\n    Other types of cancer. Other, rarer types of breast cancer that can occur in men include Paget's disease of the nipple and inflammatory breast cancer.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Inherited genes that increase breast cancer riskSome men inherit abnormal (mutated) genes from their parents that increase the risk of breast cancer. Mutations in one of several genes, especially a gene called BRCA2, put you at greater risk of developing breast and prostate cancers.\nIf you have a strong family history of cancer, discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor may recommend that you meet with a genetic counselor in order to consider genetic testing to see if you carry genes that increase your risk of cancer.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing male breast cancerYour doctor may conduct a number of diagnostic tests and procedures, such as:\n\n    Clinical breast exam. The doctor uses his or her fingertips to examine your breasts and surrounding areas for lumps or other changes. Your doctor assesses how large the lumps are, how they feel, and how close they are to your skin and muscles.\n    Imaging tests. Imaging tests create pictures of your breast tissue that allow doctors to identify abnormal areas. Tests may include a breast X-ray (mammogram) or an ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create images.\n    \n    Removing a sample of breast cells for testing (biopsy). A biopsy is the only definitive way to make a diagnosis of breast cancer. During a biopsy, your doctor uses a specialized needle device guided by X-ray or another imaging test to extract a core of tissue from the suspicious area.\n    Biopsy samples are sent to a laboratory for analysis where experts determine whether the cells are cancerous. A biopsy sample is also analyzed to determine the type of cells involved in the breast cancer, the aggressiveness (grade) of the cancer, and whether the cancer cells have hormone receptors or other receptors that may influence your treatment options.\n    \n\nOther tests and procedures may be recommended depending on your particular situation.\n        \n            \n            Determining the extent of the cancerOnce your doctor has diagnosed your breast cancer, he or she works to establish the extent (stage) of your cancer. Your cancer's stage helps determine your prognosis and the best treatment options.\nTests and procedures used to stage breast cancer may include:\n\n    Bone scan\n    Computerized tomography (CT) scan\n    Positron emission tomography (PET) scan\n\nBreast cancer stages range from 0 to IV with 0 indicating cancer that is noninvasive or contained within the milk ducts. Stage IV breast cancer, also called metastatic breast cancer, indicates cancer that has spread to other areas of the body.\nBreast cancer staging also takes into account your cancer's grade; the presence of tumor markers, such as receptors for estrogen, progesterone and HER2; and proliferation factors.More InformationBreast self-exam for breast awarenessCT scanMammogramNeedle biopsySentinel node biopsyUltrasoundX-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "To determine your treatment options, your doctor considers your cancer's stage, your overall health and your preferences. Male breast cancer treatment often involves surgery and may also include other treatments.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryThe goal of surgery is to remove the tumor and surrounding breast tissue. The procedures include:\n\n    Removing all of the breast tissue (mastectomy). The surgeon removes all of your breast tissue, including the nipple and areola.\n    Removing a few lymph nodes for testing (sentinel lymph node biopsy). The doctor identifies the lymph nodes most likely to be the first place your cancer cells would spread. Those few lymph nodes are removed and analyzed. If no cancer cells are found, there is a good chance that your breast cancer hasn't spread beyond your breast tissue. If cancer is found, additional lymph nodes are removed for testing.\n\n        \n            \n            Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. In male breast cancer, radiation therapy may be used after surgery to eliminate any remaining cancer cells in the breast, chest muscles or armpit.\nDuring radiation therapy, radiation comes from a large machine that moves around your body, directing the energy beams to precise points on your chest.\n        \n            \n            Hormone therapyMost men with male breast cancer have tumors that rely on hormones to grow (hormone-sensitive). If your cancer is hormone-sensitive, your doctor may recommend hormone therapy.\nHormone therapy for male breast cancer often involves the medication tamoxifen. Other hormone therapy medications that are used in women with breast cancer haven't been shown to be effective for men.\n        \n            \n            ChemotherapyChemotherapy uses medications to kill cancer cells. These medications may be administered through a vein in your arm (intravenously), in pill form or by both methods.\nYour doctor might recommend chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might have spread outside your breast. Chemotherapy may also be an option for men with advanced breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

{"Diseases": "Inflammatory breast cancer", "Symptoms": "Inflammatory breast cancer doesn't commonly form a lump, as occurs with other forms of breast cancer. Instead, signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include:\n\n    Rapid change in the appearance of one breast, over the course of several weeks\n    Thickness, heaviness or visible enlargement of one breast\n    Discoloration, giving the breast a red, purple, pink or bruised appearance\n    Unusual warmth of the affected breast\n    Dimpling or ridges on the skin of the affected breast, similar to an orange peel\n    Tenderness, pain or aching\n    Enlarged lymph nodes under the arm, above the collarbone or below the collarbone\n    Flattening or turning inward of the nipple\n\nFor inflammatory breast cancer to be diagnosed, these symptoms must have been present for less than six months.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorMake an appointment with your doctor if you notice any signs or symptoms that worry you.\nOther more common conditions have signs and symptoms resembling those of inflammatory breast cancer. A breast injury or breast infection (mastitis) may cause redness, swelling and pain.\nInflammatory breast cancer can be easily confused with a breast infection, which is much more common. It's reasonable and common to be initially treated with antibiotics for a week or more. If your symptoms respond to antibiotics, additional testing isn't necessary. But if the redness does not improve, your doctor may consider more serious causes of your symptoms, such as inflammatory breast cancer.\nIf you've been treated for a breast infection but your signs and symptoms persist, contact your doctor. Your doctor may recommend a mammogram or other test to evaluate your signs and symptoms. The only way to determine whether your symptoms are caused by inflammatory breast cancer is to do a biopsy to remove a sample of tissue for testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

The lobes are further divided into smaller lobules that produce milk for breastfeeding. Small tubes (ducts) conduct the milk to a reservoir that lies just beneath your nipple.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not clear what causes inflammatory breast cancer.\nDoctors know that inflammatory breast cancer begins when a breast cell develops changes in its DNA. Most often the cell is located in one of the tubes (ducts) that carry breast milk to the nipple. But the cancer can also begin with a cell in the glandular tissue (lobules) where breast milk is produced.\nA cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes to the DNA tell the breast cell to grow and divide rapidly. The accumulating abnormal cells infiltrate and clog the lymphatic vessels in the skin of the breast. The blockage in the lymphatic vessels causes red, swollen and dimpled skin \u2014 a classic sign of inflammatory breast cancer.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing inflammatory breast cancerTests and procedures used to diagnose inflammatory breast cancer include:\n\n    A physical exam. Your doctor examines your breast to look for redness and other signs of inflammatory breast cancer.\n    Imaging tests. Your doctor may recommend a breast X-ray (mammogram) or a breast ultrasound to look for signs of cancer in your breast, such as thickened skin. Additional imaging tests, such as an MRI, may be recommended in certain situations.\n    Removing a sample of tissue for testing. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of suspicious breast tissue for testing. The tissue is analyzed in a laboratory to look for signs of cancer. A skin biopsy may also be helpful, and this can be done at the same time as a breast biopsy.\n\n        \n            \n            Determining the extent of the cancerAdditional tests may be necessary to determine whether your cancer has spread to your lymph nodes or to other areas of your body.\nTests may include a CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan and bone scan. Not everyone needs every test, so your doctor will select the most appropriate tests based on your particular situation.\nYour doctor uses information from these tests to assign your cancer a stage. Your cancer's stage is indicated in Roman numerals. Because inflammatory breast cancer is aggressive and grows quickly, stages usually range from III to IV, with the higher stage indicating that cancer has spread to other areas of the body.\nThe cancer staging system continues to evolve and is becoming more complex as doctors improve cancer diagnosis and treatment. Your doctor uses your cancer stage to select the treatments that are right for you.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your inflammatory breast cancer-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationInflammatory breast cancer care at Mayo ClinicBone scanBreast MRICT scanMammogramMRIUltrasoundShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Inflammatory breast cancer treatment begins with chemotherapy. If the cancer hasn't spread to other areas of the body, treatment continues with surgery and radiation therapy. If the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, your doctor may recommend other drug treatments in addition to chemotherapy to slow the growth of the cancer. \n        \n            \n            ChemotherapyChemotherapy uses drugs to destroy fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells. You may receive chemotherapy drugs through a vein (intravenously), in pill form or both.\nChemotherapy is used prior to surgery for inflammatory breast cancer. This pre-surgical treatment, referred to as neoadjuvant therapy, aims to shrink the cancer before the operation and increase the chance that surgery will be successful.\nIf your cancer has a high risk of returning or spreading to another part of your body, your doctor may recommend additional chemotherapy after you've completed other treatments in order to decrease the chance that the cancer will recur.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryAfter chemotherapy, you may have an operation to remove the affected breast and some of the nearby lymph nodes. The operation usually includes:\n\n    Surgery to remove the breast (mastectomy). A total mastectomy includes removing all of the breast tissue \u2014 the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue and some skin, including the nipple and areola.\n    Surgery to remove the nearby lymph nodes. The surgeon will remove the lymph nodes under the arm and near the affected breast (axillary dissection).\n\nTalk with your doctor about your options for breast reconstruction. Surgery to reconstruct the breast is often delayed until after you complete all of your breast cancer treatments.\n        \n            \n            Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy is typically done using a large machine that aims the energy beams at your body (external beam radiation).\nFor inflammatory breast cancer, radiation therapy is used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain. The radiation is aimed at your chest, armpit and shoulder.\n        \n            \n            Targeted therapyTargeted drug treatments attack specific abnormalities within cancer cells. As an example, several targeted therapy drugs focus on a protein that some breast cancer cells overproduce called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The protein helps breast cancer cells grow and survive. By targeting cells that make too much HER2, the drugs can damage cancer cells while sparing healthy cells.\nIf your inflammatory breast cancer cells test positive for HER2, your doctor might recommend combining targeted therapy with your initial chemotherapy treatment. After surgery, targeted therapy can be combined with hormone therapy.\nFor cancer that spreads to other parts of the body, targeted therapy drugs that focus on other abnormalities within cancer cells are available. Your cancer cells may be tested to see which targeted therapies might be helpful for you. \n        \n            \n            Hormone therapyHormone therapy \u2014 perhaps more properly termed hormone-blocking therapy \u2014 is used to treat breast cancers that use your hormones to grow. Doctors refer to these cancers as estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) and progesterone receptor positive (PR positive) cancers.\nHormone therapy can be used after surgery or other treatments to decrease the chance of your cancer returning. If the cancer has already spread, hormone therapy may shrink and control it.\nTreatments that can be used in hormone therapy include:\n\n    Medications that block hormones from attaching to cancer cells (selective estrogen receptor modulators)\n    Medications that stop the body from making estrogen after menopause (aromatase inhibitors)\n    Surgery or medications to stop hormone production in the ovaries\n\n        \n            \n            ImmunotherapyImmunotherapy uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.\nImmunotherapy might be an option if your cancer has spread to other areas of the body and is triple negative, which means that the cancer cells don't have receptors for estrogen, progesterone or HER2. Your doctor may test your cancer cells to see if they're likely to respond to immunotherapy.\n        \n            \n            Supportive (palliative) carePalliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing other aggressive treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n\nWhen palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer.\n\nPalliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.\n\nBreast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.\n\nResearchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Inherited breast cancerDoctors estimate that about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers are linked to gene mutations passed through generations of a family.\n\nA number of inherited mutated genes that can increase the likelihood of breast cancer have been identified. The most well-known are breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2), both of which significantly increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nIf you have a strong family history of breast cancer or other cancers, your doctor may recommend a blood test to help identify specific mutations in BRCA or other genes that are being passed through your family.\n\nConsider asking your doctor for a referral to a genetic counselor, who can review your family health history. A genetic counselor can also discuss the benefits, risks and limitations of genetic testing to assist you with shared decision-making.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing breast cancer\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Core needle biopsy\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCore needle biopsy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCore needle biopsy\n\t\t\t\tA core needle biopsy uses a long, hollow tube to extract a sample of tissue.

Your breasts fit into a hollow depression in the table, which contains coils that detect magnetic signals. The table slides into the large opening of the MRI machine.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nTests and procedures used to diagnose breast cancer include:\n\n    Breast exam. Your doctor will check both of your breasts and lymph nodes in your armpit, feeling for any lumps or other abnormalities.\n    Mammogram. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. Mammograms are commonly used to screen for breast cancer. If an abnormality is detected on a screening mammogram, your doctor may recommend a diagnostic mammogram to further evaluate that abnormality.\n    Breast ultrasound. Ultrasound uses sound waves to produce images of structures deep within the body. Ultrasound may be used to determine whether a new breast lump is a solid mass or a fluid-filled cyst.\n    \n    Removing a sample of breast cells for testing (biopsy). A biopsy is the only definitive way to make a diagnosis of breast cancer. During a biopsy, your doctor uses a specialized needle device guided by X-ray or another imaging test to extract a core of tissue from the suspicious area. Often, a small metal marker is left at the site within your breast so the area can be easily identified on future imaging tests.\n    Biopsy samples are sent to a laboratory for analysis where experts determine whether the cells are cancerous. A biopsy sample is also analyzed to determine the type of cells involved in the breast cancer, the aggressiveness (grade) of the cancer, and whether the cancer cells have hormone receptors or other receptors that may influence your treatment options.\n    \n    Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI machine uses a magnet and radio waves to create pictures of the interior of your breast. Before a breast MRI, you receive an injection of dye. Unlike other types of imaging tests, an MRI doesn't use radiation to create the images.\n\nOther tests and procedures may be used depending on your situation.\n        \n            \n            Staging breast cancerOnce your doctor has diagnosed your breast cancer, he or she works to establish the extent (stage) of your cancer. Your cancer's stage helps determine your prognosis and the best treatment options.\nComplete information about your cancer's stage may not be available until after you undergo breast cancer surgery.\nTests and procedures used to stage breast cancer may include:\n\n    Blood tests, such as a complete blood count\n    Mammogram of the other breast to look for signs of cancer\n    Breast MRI\n    Bone scan\n    Computerized tomography (CT) scan\n    Positron emission tomography (PET) scan\n\nNot all women will need all of these tests and procedures. Your doctor selects the appropriate tests based on your specific circumstances and taking into account new symptoms you may be experiencing.\nBreast cancer stages range from 0 to IV with 0 indicating cancer that is noninvasive or contained within the milk ducts. Stage IV breast cancer, also called metastatic breast cancer, indicates cancer that has spread to other areas of the body.\nBreast cancer staging also takes into account your cancer's grade; the presence of tumor markers, such as receptors for estrogen, progesterone and HER2; and proliferation factors.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your breast cancer-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationBreast cancer care at Mayo ClinicBreast cancer stagingBreast cancer typesMetastatic breast cancer: Should you get a second opinion?3D mammogramBone scanBRCA gene testBreast MRIBreast self-exam for breast awarenessChest X-raysComplete blood count (CBC)CT scanMammogramMolecular breast imagingMRIPositron emission tomography scanSentinel node biopsyUltrasoundX-rayShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Your doctor determines your breast cancer treatment options based on your type of breast cancer, its stage and grade, size, and whether the cancer cells are sensitive to hormones. Your doctor also considers your overall health and your own preferences.\nMost women undergo surgery for breast cancer and many also receive additional treatment after surgery, such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy or radiation. Chemotherapy might also be used before surgery in certain situations.\nThere are many options for breast cancer treatment, and you may feel overwhelmed as you make complex decisions about your treatment. Consider seeking a second opinion from a breast specialist in a breast center or clinic.

During a lumpectomy, which may be referred to as breast-conserving surgery or wide local excision, the surgeon removes the tumor and a small margin of surrounding healthy tissue.\n    A lumpectomy may be recommended for removing smaller tumors. Some people with larger tumors may undergo chemotherapy before surgery to shrink a tumor and make it possible to remove completely with a lumpectomy procedure.\n    \n    \n    Removing the entire breast (mastectomy). A mastectomy is an operation to remove all of your breast tissue. Most mastectomy procedures remove all of the breast tissue \u2014 the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue and some skin, including the nipple and areola (total or simple mastectomy).\n    Newer surgical techniques may be an option in selected cases in order to improve the appearance of the breast. Skin-sparing mastectomy and nipple-sparing mastectomy are increasingly common operations for breast cancer.\n    \n    \n    Removing a limited number of lymph nodes (sentinel node biopsy). To determine whether cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, your surgeon will discuss with you the role of removing the lymph nodes that are the first to receive the lymph drainage from your tumor.\n    If no cancer is found in those lymph nodes, the chance of finding cancer in any of the remaining lymph nodes is small and no other nodes need to be removed.\n    \n    Removing several lymph nodes (axillary lymph node dissection). If cancer is found in the sentinel lymph nodes, your surgeon will discuss with you the role of removing additional lymph nodes in your armpit.\n    \n    Removing both breasts. Some women with cancer in one breast may choose to have their other (healthy) breast removed (contralateral prophylactic mastectomy) if they have a very increased risk of cancer in the other breast because of a genetic predisposition or strong family history.\n    Most women with breast cancer in one breast will never develop cancer in the other breast. Discuss your breast cancer risk with your doctor, along with the benefits and risks of this procedure.\n    \n\nComplications of breast cancer surgery depend on the procedures you choose. Breast cancer surgery carries a risk of pain, bleeding, infection and arm swelling (lymphedema).\nYou may choose to have breast reconstruction after surgery. Discuss your options and preferences with your surgeon.\nConsider a referral to a plastic surgeon before your breast cancer surgery. Your options may include reconstruction with a breast implant (silicone or water) or reconstruction using your own tissue. These operations can be performed at the time of your mastectomy or at a later date.\n        \n            \n            Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy is typically done using a large machine that aims the energy beams at your body (external beam radiation). But radiation can also be done by placing radioactive material inside your body (brachytherapy).\nExternal beam radiation of the whole breast is commonly used after a lumpectomy. Breast brachytherapy may be an option after a lumpectomy if you have a low risk of cancer recurrence.\nDoctors may also recommend radiation therapy to the chest wall after a mastectomy for larger breast cancers or cancers that have spread to the lymph nodes.\nBreast cancer radiation can last from three days to six weeks, depending on the treatment. A doctor who uses radiation to treat cancer (radiation oncologist) determines which treatment is best for you based on your situation, your cancer type and the location of your tumor.\nSide effects of radiation therapy include fatigue and a red, sunburn-like rash where the radiation is aimed. Breast tissue may also appear swollen or more firm. Rarely, more-serious problems may occur, such as damage to the heart or lungs or, very rarely, second cancers in the treated area.\n        \n            \n            ChemotherapyChemotherapy uses drugs to destroy fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells. If your cancer has a high risk of returning or spreading to another part of your body, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy after surgery to decrease the chance that the cancer will recur.\nChemotherapy is sometimes given before surgery in women with larger breast tumors. The goal is to shrink a tumor to a size that makes it easier to remove with surgery.\nChemotherapy is also used in women whose cancer has already spread to other parts of the body. Chemotherapy may be recommended to try to control the cancer and decrease any symptoms the cancer is causing.\nChemotherapy side effects depend on the drugs you receive. Common side effects include hair loss, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and an increased risk of developing an infection. Rare side effects can include premature menopause, infertility (if premenopausal), damage to the heart and kidneys, nerve damage, and, very rarely, blood cell cancer.\n        \n            \n            Hormone therapyHormone therapy \u2014 perhaps more properly termed hormone-blocking therapy \u2014 is used to treat breast cancers that are sensitive to hormones. Doctors refer to these cancers as estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) and progesterone receptor positive (PR positive) cancers.\nHormone therapy can be used before or after surgery or other treatments to decrease the chance of your cancer returning. If the cancer has already spread, hormone therapy may shrink and control it.\nTreatments that can be used in hormone therapy include:\n\n    Medications that block hormones from attaching to cancer cells (selective estrogen receptor modulators)\n    Medications that stop the body from making estrogen after menopause (aromatase inhibitors)\n    Surgery or medications to stop hormone production in the ovaries\n\nHormone therapy side effects depend on your specific treatment, but may include hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. More serious side effects include a risk of bone thinning and blood clots.\n        \n            \n            Targeted therapy drugsTargeted drug treatments attack specific abnormalities within cancer cells. As an example, several targeted therapy drugs focus on a protein that some breast cancer cells overproduce called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The protein helps breast cancer cells grow and survive. By targeting cells that make too much HER2, the drugs can damage cancer cells while sparing healthy cells.\nTargeted therapy drugs that focus on other abnormalities within cancer cells are available. And targeted therapy is an active area of cancer research.\nYour cancer cells may be tested to see whether you might benefit from targeted therapy drugs. Some medications are used after surgery to reduce the risk that the cancer will return. Others are used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow the growth of the tumor.\n        \n            \n            ImmunotherapyImmunotherapy uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that blind the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.\n\nImmunotherapy might be an option if you have triple-negative breast cancer, which means that the cancer cells don't have receptors for estrogen, progesterone or HER2. For triple-negative breast cancer, immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy to treat advanced cancer that's spread to other parts of the body. \n\n        \n            \n            Supportive (palliative) carePalliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing other aggressive treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\nWhen palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer.\nPalliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

These mutations allow cells to grow and divide at increased rates and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The result is a mass of abnormal cells, which forms a tumor.\n\nMany different types of brain tumors \u2014 which may or may not be cancerous \u2014 can occur in children. \n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "If it's suspected that your child has a brain tumor, the doctor may recommend several tests and procedures to aid in diagnosis and help determine treatment options.\n\n    Neurological exam. This exam may include, among other things, checking your child's vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes. Difficulty in certain areas may provide clues about the part of the brain that could be affected by a brain tumor.\n    Imaging tests. Imaging tests help determine the location and size of the brain tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often done. It may be used along with specialized MRI, such as functional MRI or magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Other imaging tests include computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET).\n    Biopsy. Removing a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy) may be done as part of surgery to remove the brain tumor. Or if the brain tumor is hard to reach or in a sensitive area that might be damaged by extensive surgery, a stereotactic needle biopsy may be done. The pediatric neurosurgeon drills a small hole into the skull, inserts a thin needle through the hole and removes tissue using the needle. The biopsy sample is analyzed in a lab to determine the types of cells and their level of aggressiveness.\n    Precision medicine diagnosis. In addition to traditional biopsy analysis, tumor tissue can also be tested for genetic mutations and the molecular basis of the tumor. Targeted drug therapy can then be tailored to the individual's needs.\n    Tests to see if cancer has spread. If it's suspected that your child's brain tumor may be a result of cancer that has spread from another area of the body, the doctor may recommend tests and procedures to determine where the cancer started.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your pediatric brain tumors-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment for a pediatric brain tumor depends on the type, size and location of the tumor, as well as your child's age and overall health. \n        \n            \n            SurgeryIf the brain tumor is located in a place that makes it accessible for an operation, your child's pediatric neurosurgeon will work to remove as much of the brain tumor as safely as possible.\n\nIn some cases, tumors are small and easy to separate from surrounding brain tissue, which makes complete surgical removal possible. In other cases, tumors can't be separated from surrounding tissue or they're located near sensitive areas in the brain, making surgery risky. In these situations the pediatric neurosurgeon removes as much of the tumor as possible.\n\nEven removing a portion of the brain tumor may help reduce signs and symptoms. Surgery to remove a pediatric brain tumor carries risks, such as infection and bleeding. Other risks may depend on the part of your child's brain where the tumor is located. For instance, surgery on a tumor near nerves that connect to the eyes may carry a risk of vision loss.\n\n        \n            \n            Traditional radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill tumor cells. Radiation therapy can come from a machine outside the body (external beam radiation), or, in very rare cases, radiation can be placed inside the body close to the brain tumor (brachytherapy).\n\nExternal beam radiation can focus just on the area of your child's brain where the tumor is located, or it can be applied to the entire brain (whole-brain radiation). Whole-brain radiation is most often used to treat cancer that has spread to the brain from some other part of the body.\n\nSide effects of radiation therapy depend on the type and dose of radiation your child receives. Common side effects, during or immediately following radiation, include fatigue, scalp irritation temporary hair loss and headaches. Sometimes nausea and vomiting occur, but anti-nausea medication can help control those symptoms.\n\n        \n            \n            Proton beam therapyAvailable at only a limited number of major health care facilities in the United States, proton beam therapy delivers higher targeted doses of radiation to brain tumors, minimizing radiation exposure to nearby healthy tissue. This appears to reduce short-term and long-term side effects and reduces the chance of developing new cancers.\n\nProton beam therapy is especially beneficial for children with certain types of brain tumors because a child's brain is still developing and especially sensitive to the effects of even low and medium doses of radiation. \n\t\n\n    \n    \n    Left image: In traditional radiation therapy, X-rays (photons) travel beyond the target area, shown in red. The blue highlights areas that are exposed to radiation by photons as they go through the body. Right image: In proton beam therapy, protons can be programmed to stop at a certain depth to eliminate unnecessary radiation exposure to other parts of the body.\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            RadiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery uses multiple beams of radiation to give a highly focused form of radiation treatment to kill the tumor cells in a very small area. Each beam of radiation isn't particularly powerful, but the point where all the beams meet \u2014 at the brain tumor \u2014 receives a very large dose of radiation to kill the tumor cells.\n\nThere are different types of technology used in radiosurgery to deliver radiation to treat brain tumors, such as a Gamma Knife or linear accelerator (LINAC). Radiosurgery is typically done in one treatment, and in most cases your child can go home the same day. \n\n        \n            \n            ChemotherapyChemotherapy uses drugs to kill tumor cells. Although the drugs can be taken orally in pill form, in children with pediatric brain tumors the drugs are usually injected into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy). Many chemotherapy drugs are available, and options depend on the type of cancer.\n\nChemotherapy side effects depend on the type and dose of drugs. General side effects of chemotherapy include nausea, vomiting, temporary hair loss and reduced production of blood cells (myelosuppression). \n\n        \n            \n            Targeted drug therapyTargeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die.\n\nFor example, one targeted drug therapy used to treat a type of brain cancer called a low-grade glioma is bevacizumab (Avastin). This drug, given through a vein (intravenously), stops the formation of new blood vessels, cutting off blood supply to a tumor and killing the tumor cells.\n\nDrugs such as dabrafenib, vemurafenib, trametinib, everolimus and various other drugs are currently being used to treat brain tumors if the molecular target is identified in the tumor.\n\nWith better understanding of the molecular basis for tumor formation, there are several clinical trials underway using targeted drug therapy. \n\n        \n            \n            Rehabilitation after treatmentBecause brain tumors can develop in parts of the brain that control motor skills, speech, vision and thinking, rehabilitation may be a necessary part of recovery. Your doctor may refer you to services that can help your child, such as:\n\n\nPhysical therapy to help your child regain lost motor skills or muscle strength\nOccupational therapy to help your child get back to daily activities\nSpeech therapy if your child has difficulty speaking\nTutoring if your school-age child needs help to cope with changes in memory and thinking after a brain tumor\n\n\n        \n            \n            "},

Medulloblastoma is the most common type of cancerous brain tumor in children.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimary brain tumors originate in the brain itself or in tissues close to it, such as in the brain-covering membranes (meninges), cranial nerves, pituitary gland or pineal gland.\nPrimary brain tumors begin when normal cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations tell the cells to grow and divide rapidly and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The result is a mass of abnormal cells, which forms a tumor.\nIn adults, primary brain tumors are much less common than are secondary brain tumors, in which cancer begins elsewhere and spreads to the brain.\nMany different types of primary brain tumors exist. Each gets its name from the type of cells involved. Examples include:\n\n    Gliomas. These tumors begin in the brain or spinal cord and include astrocytomas, ependymomas, glioblastomas, oligoastrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.\n    Meningiomas. A meningioma is a tumor that arises from the membranes that surround your brain and spinal cord (meninges). Most meningiomas are noncancerous.\n    Acoustic neuromas (schwannomas). These are benign tumors that develop on the nerves that control balance and hearing leading from your inner ear to your brain.\n    Pituitary adenomas. These are tumors that develop in the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. These tumors can affect the pituitary hormones with effects throughout the body.\n    Medulloblastomas. These cancerous brain tumors are most common in children, though they can occur at any age. A medulloblastoma starts in the lower back part of the brain and tends to spread through the spinal fluid.\n    Germ cell tumors. Germ cell tumors may develop during childhood where the testicles or ovaries will form. But sometimes germ cell tumors affect other parts of the body, such as the brain.\n    Craniopharyngiomas. These rare tumors start near the brain's pituitary gland, which secretes hormones that control many body functions. As the craniopharyngioma slowly grows, it can affect the pituitary gland and other structures near the brain.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Cancer that begins elsewhere and spreads to the brainSecondary (metastatic) brain tumors are tumors that result from cancer that starts elsewhere in your body and then spreads (metastasizes) to your brain.\nSecondary brain tumors most often occur in people who have a history of cancer. Rarely, a metastatic brain tumor may be the first sign of cancer that began elsewhere in your body.\nIn adults, secondary brain tumors are far more common than are primary brain tumors.\nAny cancer can spread to the brain, but common types include:\n\n    Breast cancer\n    Colon cancer\n    Kidney cancer\n    Lung cancer\n    Melanoma\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "If it's suspected that you have a brain tumor, your doctor may recommend a number of tests and procedures, including:\n\n    A neurological exam.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used to help diagnose brain tumors. Sometimes a dye is injected through a vein in your arm during your MRI study.\n    A number of specialized MRI scan components \u2014 including functional MRI, perfusion MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy \u2014 may help your doctor evaluate the tumor and plan treatment.\n    Sometimes other imaging tests are recommended in certain situations, including computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET).\n    \n    \n    Collecting and testing a sample of abnormal tissue (biopsy).

Common side effects during or immediately following radiation include fatigue, headaches, memory loss, scalp irritation and hair loss.\n        \n            \n            Radiosurgery\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery\n\t\t\t\tGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to a target.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery is not a form of surgery in the traditional sense. Instead, radiosurgery uses multiple beams of radiation to give a highly focused form of radiation treatment to kill the tumor cells in a very small area. Each beam of radiation isn't particularly powerful, but the point where all the beams meet \u2014 at the brain tumor \u2014 receives a very large dose of radiation to kill the tumor cells.\nThere are different types of technology used in radiosurgery to deliver radiation to treat brain tumors, such as a Gamma Knife or linear accelerator.\nRadiosurgery is typically done in one treatment, and usually you can go home the same day.\n        \n            \n            ChemotherapyChemotherapy uses drugs to kill tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs can be taken orally in pill form or injected into a vein (intravenously). The chemotherapy drug used most often to treat brain tumors is temozolomide (Temodar). Other chemotherapy drugs may be recommended depending on the type of cancer.\nChemotherapy side effects depend on the type and dose of drugs you receive. Chemotherapy can cause nausea, vomiting and hair loss.\nTests of your brain tumor cells can determine whether chemotherapy will be helpful for you. The type of brain tumor you have also is helpful in determining whether to recommend chemotherapy.\n        \n            \n            Targeted drug therapyTargeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die.\nTargeted therapy drugs are available for certain types of brain tumors, and many more are being studied in clinical trials. Your doctor may have your tumor cells tested to see whether targeted therapy is likely to be an effective treatment for your brain tumor.\n        \n            \n            Rehabilitation after treatmentBecause brain tumors can develop in parts of the brain that control motor skills, speech, vision and thinking, rehabilitation may be a necessary part of recovery. Depending on your needs, your doctor may refer you to:\n\n    Physical therapy to help you regain lost motor skills or muscle strength\n    Occupational therapy to help you get back to your normal daily activities, including work, after a brain tumor or other illness\n    Speech therapy with specialists in speech difficulties (speech pathologists) to help if you have difficulty speaking\n    Tutoring for school-age children to help kids cope with changes in their memory and thinking after a brain tumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the signs and symptoms of CF show up.\nCystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder disease and are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia.\nPeople with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat.

Early diagnosis means that treatment can begin immediately.\nIn one screening test, a blood sample is checked for higher than normal levels of a chemical called immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), which is released by the pancreas. A newborn's IRT levels may be high because of premature birth or a stressful delivery. For that reason, other tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.\nTo evaluate if an infant has cystic fibrosis, doctors may also conduct a sweat test once the infant is at least 2 weeks old. A sweat-producing chemical is applied to a small area of skin. Then the sweat is collected to test it and see if it's saltier than normal. Testing done at a care center accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation helps ensure reliable results.\nDoctors may also recommend genetic tests for specific defects on the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. Genetic tests may be used in addition to checking the IRT levels to confirm the diagnosis.\n        \n            \n            Testing of older children and adultsCystic fibrosis tests may be recommended for older children and adults who weren't screened at birth.

They may improve lung function and weight, and reduce the amount of salt in sweat.\nThe FDA has approved these medications for treating CF in people with one or more mutations in the CFTR gene:\n\n    The newest combination medication containing elexacaftor, ivacaftor and tezacaftor (Trikafta) is approved for people age 12 years and older and considered a breakthrough by many experts.\n    The combination medication containing tezacaftor and ivacaftor (Symdeko) is approved for people age 6 years and older.\n    The combination medication containing lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi) is approved for people who are age 2 years and older.\n    Ivacaftor (Kalydeco) has been approved for people who are 6 months and older.\n\n\n        \n            \n            \n\n\nA milestone treatment for CF\n\n\nTim Myer has lived with cystic fibrosis (CF) his whole life. He was awaiting a lung transplant when a new medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration changed everything. Myer and Dr. Mark Wylam, a Mayo Clinic pulmonologist who is Myer's physician, share the remarkable story.\n\nMayo Clinic Q&A podcast\n\n\n\n\nDoctors may conduct liver function tests and eye exams before prescribing these medications. While taking these drugs, testing on a regular basis is needed to check for side effects such as liver function abnormalities and cataracts. Ask your doctor and pharmacist for information on possible side effects and what to watch for. \nKeep regular follow-up appointments so your doctor can monitor you while taking these medications. Talk to your doctor about any side effects that you experience.\n        \n            \n            Airway clearance techniques\t\n\n    \n    Vest therapy\n    Using a personalized approach, a Mayo Clinic respiratory therapist discusses inflatable vest therapy with an adult who has cystic fibrosis.\n\n\nAirway clearance techniques \u2014 also called chest physical therapy (CPT) \u2014 can relieve mucus obstruction and help to reduce infection and inflammation in the airways. These techniques loosen the thick mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up.\nAirway clearing techniques are usually done several times a day. Different types of CPT can be used to loosen and remove mucus, and a combination of techniques may be recommended.\n\n    A common technique is clapping with cupped hands on the front and back of the chest.\n    Certain breathing and coughing techniques also may be used to help loosen the mucus.\n    Mechanical devices can help loosen lung mucus. Devices include a tube that you blow into and a machine that pulses air into the lungs (vibrating vest). Vigorous exercise also may be used to clear mucus.\n\nYour doctor will instruct you on the type and frequency of chest physical therapy that's best for you.\n        \n            \n            Pulmonary rehabilitationYour doctor may recommend a long-term program that may improve your lung function and overall well-being. Pulmonary rehabilitation is usually done on an outpatient basis and may include:\n\n    Physical exercise that may improve your condition\n    Breathing techniques that may help loosen mucus and improve breathing\n    Nutritional counseling\n    Counseling and support\n    Education about your condition\n\n        \n            \n            Surgical and other proceduresOptions for certain conditions caused by cystic fibrosis include:\n\n    Nasal and sinus surgery. Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove nasal polyps that obstruct breathing. Sinus surgery may be done to treat recurrent or chronic sinusitis.\n    Oxygen therapy. If your blood oxygen level declines, your doctor may recommend that you breathe pure oxygen to prevent high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension).\n    Noninvasive ventilation. Typically used while sleeping, noninvasive ventilation uses a nose or mouth mask to provide positive pressure in the airway and lungs when you breathe in. It's often used in combination with oxygen therapy. Noninvasive ventilation can increase air exchange in the lungs and decrease the work of breathing. The treatment may also help with airway clearance.\n    Feeding tube. Cystic fibrosis interferes with digestion, so you can't absorb nutrients from food very well. Your doctor may suggest using a feeding tube to deliver extra nutrition. This tube may be a temporary tube inserted into your nose and guided to your stomach, or the tube may be surgically implanted in the abdomen. The tube can be used to give extra calories during the day or night and does not prevent eating by mouth.\n    Bowel surgery. If a blockage develops in your bowel, you may need surgery to remove it. Intussusception, where a segment of intestine has telescoped inside an adjacent section of intestine, also may require surgical repair.\n    \n    Lung transplant. If you have severe breathing problems, life-threatening lung complications or increasing resistance to antibiotics for lung infections, lung transplantation may be an option. Because bacteria line the airways in diseases that cause permanent widening of the large airways (bronchiectasis), such as cystic fibrosis, both lungs need to be replaced.\n    Cystic fibrosis does not recur in transplanted lungs. However, other complications associated with CF \u2014 such as sinus infections, diabetes, pancreas conditions and osteoporosis \u2014 can still occur after a lung transplant.\n    \n    Liver transplant. For severe cystic fibrosis-related liver disease, such as cirrhosis, liver transplant may be an option. In some people, a liver transplant may be combined with lung or pancreas transplants.\nMore InformationCystic fibrosis care at Mayo ClinicHome enteral nutritionLung transplantInfographic: Lung Transplant for Cystic FibrosisShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Other types of cysts are much less common.\nFunctional cysts\nYour ovaries normally grow cyst-like structures called follicles each month. Follicles produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone and release an egg when you ovulate.\nIf a normal monthly follicle keeps growing, it's known as a functional cyst. There are two types of functional cysts:\n\n    Follicular cyst. Around the midpoint of your menstrual cycle, an egg bursts out of its follicle and travels down the fallopian tube. A follicular cyst begins when the follicle doesn't rupture or release its egg, but continues to grow.\n    Corpus luteum cyst. When a follicle releases its egg, it begins producing estrogen and progesterone for conception. This follicle is now called the corpus luteum. Sometimes, fluid accumulates inside the follicle, causing the corpus luteum to grow into a cyst.\n\nFunctional cysts are usually harmless, rarely cause pain, and often disappear on their own within two or three menstrual cycles.\nOther cysts\nTypes of cysts not related to the normal function of your menstrual cycle include:\n\n    Dermoid cysts. Also called teratomas, these can contain tissue, such as hair, skin or teeth, because they form from embryonic cells. They're rarely cancerous.\n    Cystadenomas. These develop on the surface of an ovary and might be filled with a watery or a mucous material.\n    Endometriomas. These develop as a result of a condition in which uterine endometrial cells grow outside your uterus (endometriosis). Some of the tissue can attach to your ovary and form a growth.\n\nDermoid cysts and cystadenomas can become large, causing the ovary to move out of position. This increases the chance of painful twisting of your ovary, called ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion may also result in decreasing or stopping blood flow to the ovary.\r\n\r\n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n (function() {\n    kWidget.embed({\"targetId\":\"kaltura-video-1_9d7nfw52\",\"wid\":\"_1825021\",\"uiconf_id\":44373111,\"flashvars\":{\"IframeCustomPluginCss1\":\"/-/media/kcms/ux/css/kaltura-player.css\",\"localizationCode\":\"auto\",\"autoPlay\":false},\"cache_st\":20200805,\"entry_id\":\"1_9d7nfw52\",\"readyCallback\": function(playerId) {var kdp = document.getElementById(playerId); kdp.addJsListener('doPlay', 'doPlayCallback'); window.inlineReadyCallbackCalled = playerId; }});\n  })();\n \r\n\r\nVideo: Ovulation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow transcript for video Video: Ovulation\r\n\r\n\nOvulation is the release of an egg from one of the ovaries. It often happens about midway through the menstrual cycle, although the exact timing may vary.\n\n\nIn preparation for ovulation, the lining of the uterus, or endometrium, thickens. The pituitary gland in the brain stimulates one of the ovaries to release an egg. The wall of the ovarian follicle ruptures at the surface of the ovary. The egg is released.\n\nFinger-like structures called fimbriae sweep the egg into the neighboring fallopian tube. The egg travels through the fallopian tube, propelled in part by contractions in the fallopian tube walls. Here in the fallopian tube, the egg may be fertilized by a sperm.\n\nIf the egg is fertilized, the egg and sperm unite to form a one-celled entity called a zygote. As the zygote travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, it begins dividing rapidly to form a cluster of cells called a blastocyst, which resembles a tiny raspberry. When the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it implants in the lining of the uterus and pregnancy begins.\n\n\nIf the egg isn't fertilized, it's simply reabsorbed by the body \u2014 perhaps before it even reaches the uterus. About two weeks later, the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina. This is known as menstruation.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "A cyst on your ovary can be found during a pelvic exam.

A wandlike device (transducer) sends and receives high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to create an image of your uterus and ovaries on a video screen.

Treatment for these disorders may help you feel less compelled to hurt yourself.\n        \n            \n            Psychiatric hospitalizationIf you injure yourself severely or repeatedly, your doctor may recommend that you be admitted to a hospital for psychiatric care. Hospitalization, often short term, can provide a safe environment and more-intensive treatment until you get through a crisis. Mental health day treatment programs also may be an option.More InformationCognitive behavioral therapyPsychotherapy\n        \n            \n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Signals from the pituitary gland stimulate the adrenal glands' production of cortisol. Cortisol levels are sensed by the pituitary gland.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToo much of the hormone cortisol in your body causes Cushing syndrome. Cortisol, which is produced in the adrenal glands, plays a variety of roles in your body.\nFor example, cortisol helps regulate your blood pressure, reduces inflammation, and keeps your heart and blood vessels functioning normally. Cortisol helps your body respond to stress. It also regulates the way your body converts proteins, carbohydrates and fats in your diet into energy.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            The role of corticosteroid medications (exogenous Cushing syndrome)Cushing syndrome can develop from taking oral corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, in high doses over time.\nOral corticosteroids may be necessary to treat inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and asthma. They may also be used to prevent your body from rejecting a transplanted organ.\nIt's also possible to develop Cushing syndrome from injectable corticosteroids \u2014 for example, repeated injections for joint pain, bursitis and back pain. Inhaled steroid medicines for asthma and steroid skin creams used for skin disorders such as eczema are generally less likely to cause Cushing syndrome than are oral corticosteroids. But, in some individuals, these medications may cause Cushing syndrome, especially if taken in high doses.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Your body's own overproduction (endogenous Cushing syndrome)The condition can be due to your body producing either too much cortisol or too much adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which regulates cortisol production.\nIn these cases, Cushing syndrome may be related to:\n\n    A pituitary gland tumor (pituitary adenoma). A noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, produces an excess amount of ACTH, which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to make more cortisol. When this form of the syndrome develops, it's called Cushing disease. It occurs much more often in women and is the most common form of endogenous Cushing syndrome.\n    An ACTH-secreting tumor. Rarely, a tumor that develops in an organ that normally doesn't produce ACTH will begin to secrete this hormone in excess. These tumors, which can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant), are usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid or thymus gland.\n    \n    A primary adrenal gland disease. Disorders of the adrenal glands can cause them to produce too much cortisol. The most common is a noncancerous tumor of the adrenal cortex, called an adrenal adenoma, but only a small fraction of adenomas produce too much cortisol.\n    Cancerous tumors of the adrenal cortex are rare, but they can cause Cushing syndrome as well. Occasionally, benign, nodular enlargement of both adrenal glands can result in Cushing syndrome.\n    \n    Familial Cushing syndrome. Rarely, people inherit a tendency to develop tumors on one or more of their endocrine glands, affecting cortisol levels and causing Cushing syndrome.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Taking glucocorticoid medications is the most common cause of Cushing syndrome. Your doctor can review all your medications \u2014 pills, injections, creams and inhalers \u2014 to determine if you're taking medications that can cause the disorder. If you are, you probably won't need other tests.\nCushing syndrome from endogenous cortisol production can be difficult to diagnose because other conditions have similar signs and symptoms. Diagnosing Cushing syndrome can be a long and extensive process. You'll likely need to see a doctor who specializes in hormonal disorders (endocrinologist).\nYour doctor will conduct a physical exam and look for indications of Cushing syndrome, such as rounding of the face, a pad of fatty tissue between the shoulders and neck, and thin skin with bruises and stretch marks.\nIf you haven't been using a corticosteroid medication, these diagnostic tests may help pinpoint the cause:\n\n    \n    Urine and blood tests. These tests measure hormone levels and show whether your body is producing excessive cortisol. For the urine test, you may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. Urine and blood samples will be sent to a laboratory to be analyzed.\n    Your doctor might also recommend other specialized tests that involve measuring cortisol levels before and after using hormone medications to stimulate or suppress cortisol.\n    \n    Saliva test. Cortisol levels normally rise and fall throughout the day. In people without Cushing syndrome, levels of cortisol drop significantly in the evening. By analyzing cortisol levels from a small sample of saliva collected late at night, doctors can see if cortisol levels are too high.\n    Imaging tests. CT or MRI scans can provide images of your pituitary and adrenal glands to detect abnormalities, such as tumors.\n    \n    Petrosal sinus sampling. This test can help determine whether the cause of Cushing syndrome is rooted in the pituitary or somewhere else. For the test, blood samples are taken from the veins that drain the pituitary gland (petrosal sinuses).\n    A thin tube is inserted into your upper thigh or groin area while you're sedated and is threaded to the petrosal sinuses. Levels of ACTH are measured from the petrosal sinuses and from a blood sample taken from the forearm.\n    If the ACTH level is higher in the sinus sample, the problem stems from the pituitary. If the ACTH levels are similar between the sinuses and forearm, the root of the problem lies outside of the pituitary gland.\n    \n\nThese tests help your doctor diagnose Cushing syndrome, and they may help rule out other medical conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome \u2014 a hormone disorder in women with enlarged ovaries. Depression, eating disorders and alcoholism also can partially mimic Cushing syndrome.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Cushing syndrome-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationCushing syndrome care at Mayo ClinicCT scanMRIUrinalysisShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatments for Cushing syndrome are designed to lower the high level of cortisol in your body. The best treatment for you depends on the cause of the syndrome. Options include:\n        \n            \n            Reducing corticosteroid useIf the cause of Cushing syndrome is long-term use of corticosteroid medications, your doctor may be able to keep your Cushing syndrome signs and symptoms under control by reducing the dosage of the drug over a period of time, while still managing the condition for which you take it. Don't reduce the dose of corticosteroid drugs or stop taking them on your own. Do so only under your doctor's supervision.\nAbruptly discontinuing these medications could lead to deficient cortisol levels. Slowly tapering off corticosteroid drugs allows your body to resume normal cortisol production.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryIf the cause of Cushing syndrome is a tumor, your doctor may recommend complete surgical removal. Pituitary tumors are typically removed by a neurosurgeon, who may perform the procedure through your nose. For a tumor in the adrenal glands, lungs or pancreas, the surgeon can remove it through a standard operation or by using minimally invasive surgical techniques, with smaller incisions.\nAfter the operation, you'll need to take cortisol replacement medications to provide your body with the correct amount of cortisol. In most cases, you'll eventually return to normal adrenal hormone production, and your doctor can taper off the replacement drugs. Your endocrinologist will use blood tests to help determine if you need cortisol replacement and when it may be stopped.\nHowever, this process can take up to a year or longer. In some instances, people with Cushing syndrome never return to normal adrenal function. They then need lifelong replacement therapy.\n        \n            \n            Radiation therapyIf the surgeon can't totally remove a pituitary tumor, he or she will usually prescribe radiation therapy as well as surgery. Additionally, radiation may be used for people who aren't suitable candidates for surgery.\nRadiation can be given in small doses over a six-week period, or with a technique called stereotactic radiosurgery. In the latter procedure, a large, one-time dose of radiation is delivered to the tumor, and the radiation exposure to surrounding tissues is minimized.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsMedications can be used to control cortisol production when surgery and radiation don't work. Medications might also be used before surgery in people who have become very sick with Cushing syndrome to improve signs and symptoms and minimize surgical risk. Medical therapy may not completely improve all of the symptoms of excess cortisol.\nMedications to control excessive production of cortisol at the adrenal gland include ketoconazole, mitotane (Lysodren) and metyrapone (Metopirone).\nMifepristone (Korlym, Mifeprex) is approved for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance. Mifepristone does not decrease cortisol production, but it blocks the effect of cortisol on your tissues.\nSide effects from these medications may include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headaches, muscle aches, high blood pressure, low potassium and swelling. Some have more-serious side effects, such as neurological side effects and liver toxicity.\nNewer medications for Cushing syndrome include pasireotide (Signifor), given as a twice-daily injection, and osilodrostat (Isturisa), a pill. Other medications are being developed.\nIn some cases, the tumor or its treatment will cause the pituitary or adrenal gland to produce not enough of other hormones, and your doctor will recommend hormone replacement medications.\nIf none of these treatment options is appropriate or effective, your doctor may recommend surgical removal of your adrenal glands (bilateral adrenalectomy). This procedure will cure excess production of cortisol but will require lifelong replacement medications.More InformationCushing syndrome care at Mayo ClinicAdrenalectomyBrain stereotactic radiosurgery\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Wearing a brace won't cure scoliosis or reverse the curve, but it usually prevents the curve from getting worse.\nThe most common type of brace is made of plastic and is contoured to conform to the body. This brace is almost invisible under the clothes, as it fits under the arms and around the rib cage, lower back and hips.\nMost braces are worn between 13 and 16 hours a day. A brace's effectiveness increases with the number of hours a day it's worn. Children who wear braces can usually participate in most activities and have few restrictions. If necessary, kids can take off the brace to participate in sports or other physical activities.\nBraces are discontinued when there are no further changes in height. On average, girls complete their growth at age 14, and boys at 16, but this varies greatly by individual.\n        \n            \n            SurgerySevere scoliosis typically progresses with time, so your doctor might suggest scoliosis surgery to help straighten the curve and prevent it from getting worse.\nSurgical options include:\n\n    Spinal fusion. In this procedure, surgeons connect two or more of the bones in the spine (vertebrae) together so they can't move independently. Pieces of bone or a bone-like material are placed between the vertebrae. Metal rods, hooks, screws or wires typically hold that part of the spine straight and still while the old and new bone material fuses together.\n    Expanding rod. If the scoliosis is progressing rapidly at a young age, surgeons can attach one or two expandable rods along the spine that can adjust in length as the child grows. The rods are lengthened every 3 to 6 months either with surgery or in the clinic using a remote control.\n    Vertebral body tethering. This procedure can be performed through small incisions. Screws are placed along the outside edge of the abnormal spinal curve and a strong, flexible cord is threaded through the screws. When the cord is tightened, the spine straightens. As the child grows, the spine may straighten even more.\n\nComplications of spinal surgery may include bleeding, infection or nerve damage.More InformationScoliosis care at Mayo ClinicSpinal fusionStraightening Scoliosis\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

During sexual arousal, nerve impulses increase blood flow to both of these cylinders. This sudden influx of blood causes an erection by expanding, straightening and stiffening the penis.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cause of Peyronie's disease isn't completely understood, but a number of factors appear to be involved.\nIt's thought Peyronie's disease generally results from repeated injury to the penis. For example, the penis might be damaged during sex, athletic activity or as the result of an accident. However, most often, no specific trauma to the penis is recalled.\nDuring the healing process after injury to the penis, scar tissue forms in a disorganized manner. This can lead to a nodule you can feel or development of curvature.\nEach side of the penis contains a spongelike tube (corpus cavernosum) that contains many tiny blood vessels. Each of the corpora cavernosa is encased in a sheath of elastic tissue called the tunica albuginea (TOO-nih-kuh al-BYOO-JIN-e-uh), which stretches during an erection.\nWhen you become sexually aroused, blood flow to these chambers increases. As the chambers fill with blood, the penis expands, straightens and stiffens into an erection.\nIn Peyronie's disease, when the penis becomes erect, the region with the scar tissue doesn't stretch, and the penis bends or becomes disfigured and possibly painful.\nIn some men, Peyronie's disease comes on gradually and doesn't seem to be related to an injury. Researchers are investigating whether Peyronie's disease might be linked to an inherited trait or certain health conditions.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "A physical exam is often sufficient to identify the presence of scar tissue in the penis and diagnose Peyronie's disease. Rarely, other conditions cause similar symptoms and need to be ruled out.\nTests to diagnose Peyronie's disease and understand exactly what's causing your symptoms might include the following:\n\n    \n    Physical exam. Your doctor will feel (palpate) your penis when it's not erect, to identify the location and amount of scar tissue. He or she might also measure the length of your penis. If the condition continues to worsen, this initial measurement helps determine whether the penis has shortened.\n    Your doctor might also ask you to bring in photos of your erect penis taken at home. This can determine the degree of curvature, location of scar tissue or other details that might help identify the best treatment approach.\n    \n    \n    Other tests. Your doctor might order an ultrasound or other tests to examine your penis when it's erect. Before testing, you'll likely receive an injection directly into the penis that causes it to become erect.\n    Ultrasound is the most commonly used test for penis abnormalities. Ultrasound tests use sound waves to produce images of soft tissues. These tests can show the presence of scar tissue, blood flow to the penis and any other abnormalities.\n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Peyronie's disease-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationPeyronie's disease care at Mayo ClinicUltrasoundX-ray\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment recommendations for Peyronie's disease depend on how long it's been since you began having symptoms.\n\n    Acute phase. You have penile pain or changes in curvature or length or a deformity of the penis. The acute phase happens early in the disease and may last only two to four weeks but sometimes lasts for up to a year or longer.\n    Chronic phase. Your symptoms are stable, and you have no penile pain or changes in curvature, length or deformity of the penis. The chronic phase happens later in the disease and generally occurs around three to 12 months after symptoms begin.\n\nFor the acute phase of the disease, treatments range from:\n\n    Recommended. When used early in the disease process, penile traction therapy prevents length loss and minimizes the extent of curvature that occurs.\n    Optional. Medical and injection therapies are optional in this phase, with some more effective than others.\n    Not recommended. Surgery isn't recommended until the disease stabilizes, to avoid the need for repeat surgery.\n\nFor the chronic phase of the disease, several potential treatments are available. They may be done alone or in combination:\n\n    Watchful waiting\n    Injection treatments\n    Traction therapy\n    Surgery\n\nOral medications aren't recommended in the chronic phase, as they haven't been shown to be effective at this stage of the disease. Shock wave therapy, stem cells and platelet-rich plasma also haven't been shown to be effective in human studies.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsA number of oral medications have been tried to treat Peyronie's disease, but they have not been shown to be effective consistently and are not as effective as surgery.\nIn some men, drugs injected directly into the penis might reduce curvature and pain associated with Peyronie's disease. Depending on the therapy, you might be given a local anesthetic to prevent pain during the injections.\nIf you have one of these treatments, you'll likely receive multiple injections over several months. Injection medications may also be used in combination with oral drugs or traction therapies.\nMedications include:\n\n    \n    Collagenase. The only FDA-approved medication for Peyronie's disease is collagenase clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex). This medicine has been approved for use in adult men with moderate to severe curvatures and a palpable nodule.\n    This therapy has been shown to improve curvature and bothersome symptoms associated with Peyronie's disease. The treatment works by breaking down the buildup of collagen that causes penile curvature. Collagenase appears to be more effective when used in conjunction with \"modeling,\" which is forcible bending of the penis in the opposite direction of the bend.\n    \n    Verapamil. This is a drug normally used to treat high blood pressure. It appears to disrupt the production of collagen, a protein that might be a key factor in the formation of Peyronie's disease scar tissue. The drug is well tolerated and may reduce pain, too.\n    Interferon. This is a type of protein that appears to disrupt the production of fibrous tissue and help break it down. One placebo-controlled trial showed improvement using this therapy over placebo. Interferon also has been shown to reduce penile pain in men with Peyronie's disease.\n\n        \n            \n            Traction therapy\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Penile traction therapy\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPenile traction therapy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPenile traction therapy\n\t\t\t\tWith penile traction therapy, you wear a penile traction device for a set amount of time each day. The device may stretch the penis straight out, or it may stretch the penis in the direction that's opposite of the curve.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nPenile traction therapy involves stretching the penis with a self-applied mechanical device for a period of time to improve penile length, curvature and deformity.\nDepending on the specific device, traction therapy may need to be worn for as little as 30 minutes to as much as three to eight hours a day to achieve benefits. The effectiveness of treatment may also depend on the specific device used.\nTraction therapy is recommended in the early phase of Peyronie's disease. It's the only treatment shown to improve penile length. Traction therapy may also be used in the chronic phase of the disease, combined with other treatments or after surgery for a better outcome.\n        \n            \n            Surgery\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Plication of the penis\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPlication of the penis\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPlication of the penis\n\t\t\t\tDuring plication of the penis, an artificial erection is created from either injection of a saltwater solution or selected medications.

Surgery usually isn't recommended until you've had the condition for nine to 12 months and the curvature of your penis stops increasing and stabilizes for at least three to six months.\nCommon surgical methods include:\n\n    \n    Suturing (plicating) the unaffected side. A variety of procedures can be used to suture (plicate) the longer side of the penis \u2014 the side without scar tissue. This results in a straightening of the penis, although this is often limited to less severe curvatures.\n    Several plication techniques may be used, generally resulting in similar success rates depending on surgeon experience and preference.\n    \n    \n    Incision or excision and grafting. With this type of surgery, the surgeon makes one or more cuts in the scar tissue, allowing the sheath to stretch out and the penis to straighten. The surgeon might remove some of the scar tissue.\n    A piece of tissue (graft) is often sewn into place to cover the holes in the tunica albuginea. The graft might be tissue from your own body, human or animal tissue, or a synthetic material.\n    This procedure is generally used in men with more-severe curvature or deformity, such as indentations. This procedure is associated with greater risks of worsening erectile function when compared with the plication procedures.\n    \n    \n    Penile implants. Surgically placed penile implants are inserted into the spongy tissue that fills with blood during an erection. The implants might be semirigid \u2014 manually bent down most of the time and bent upward for sexual intercourse.\n    Another type of implant is inflated with a pump implanted in the scrotum. Penile implants might be considered if you have both Peyronie's disease and erectile dysfunction.\n    When the implants are put in place, the surgeon might perform additional procedures to improve the curvature if needed.\n    \n\nThe type of surgery used will depend on your condition. Your doctor will consider the location of scar tissue, the severity of your symptoms and other factors. If you're uncircumcised, your doctor might recommend a circumcision during surgery.\nDepending on the type of surgery you have, you might be able to go home from the hospital the same day or you might need to stay overnight. Your surgeon will advise you on how long you should wait before going back to work \u2014 generally, a few days. After surgery for Peyronie's disease, you'll need to wait four to eight weeks before sexual activity.\n        \n            \n            Other treatmentsA technique known as iontophoresis uses an electric current to administer a combination of verapamil and a steroid noninvasively through the skin. Available research has shown conflicting results on penile curvature and erectile function.\nSeveral nondrug treatments for Peyronie's disease are being investigated, but evidence is limited on how well they work and possible side effects. These include using intense sound waves to break up scar tissue (shock wave therapy), stem cells, platelet-rich plasma and radiation therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    /* hide existing \"request appointment\" buttons\\links */\n    div.requestappointment,\n    div.requestappt,\n    div.mc-callout {\n        display: none !important;\n    }\n\n    div.inlineSubCntnrMH {\n        border-top: 1px solid #111111;\n        border-bottom: 1px solid #111111;\n        margin: 24px 0 48px 0;\n        width: 100%;\n        background-color: #ffffff;\n        clear: none;\n        float: left;\n        font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n        z-index: 1;\n    }\n\n    div.inlineSubCntnrMH>div.header {\n        color: #111111;\n        font-size: 18px;\n        line-height: 24px;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        margin: 32px 24px;\n    }\n\n    div.inlineSubCntnrMH>p {\n        color: #111111;\n        font-size: 16px;\n        line-height: 24px;\n        letter-spacing: 0;\n        margin: 0 24px;\n    }\n\n    div.inlineSubCntnrMH>a {\n        color: #ffffff;\n        font-size: 16px;\n        line-height: 24px;\n        letter-spacing: 0;\n        background: #003DA5;\n        border-radius: 24px;\n        padding: 12px 40px;\n        float: left;\n        position: relative;\n        display: block;\n        text-decoration: none !important;\n        margin: 32px 24px;\n    }\n\n    div.inlineSubCntnrMH>a:hover {\n        background: #00418A;\n    }\n\n    div.inlineSubCntnrMH+div.contentbox {\n        clear: both;\n    }\n\n\n\n    Peyronie's disease care at Mayo Clinic\n    Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your health concerns.

Your doctor will examine your skin for patchy, scaly regions or solid, raised growths. You will also be examined for signs that your lymph nodes or other organs might be affected.\n    Blood tests. Blood tests such as the complete blood count might be used to better understand your condition. Sometimes cancer cells are found in the blood, particularly with Sezary syndrome.\n    \n    Skin biopsies. A procedure to cut away a small sample of skin (skin biopsy) is usually needed to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The skin might be cut with a circular tool (punch biopsy). For larger lesions and tumors the biopsy might be done with a small knife (excisional biopsy).\n    A doctor who specializes in analyzing blood and tissue (pathologist) examines the sample in a lab to determine whether it contains cancer cells. Sometimes multiple skin biopsies are necessary to confirm your diagnosis. Advanced lab tests to analyze the tissue might uncover clues about your cancer that will help your doctor understand your prognosis and determine your treatment options.\n    \n    Imaging tests. If there's concern that the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, your doctor might recommend imaging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationCutaneous T-cell lymphoma care at Mayo ClinicCT scanMRIPositron emission tomography scanSkin biopsyShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Many treatments are available for people with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Which treatments are best for you depends on your particular situation, including the extent or stage of your lymphoma. Most people receive a combination of treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\nTreatment options may include:\n\n    Skin creams and ointments. Medicines can be applied to your skin in the form of creams, gels and ointments. Corticosteroids can help control skin redness and itchiness. Chemotherapy can be applied to the skin to attack cancer cells.\n    Light therapy (phototherapy). Phototherapy involves exposing the skin to wavelengths of light, such as ultraviolet B or ultraviolet A. Various machines are used in phototherapy, including booths that expose most of your body to the light. Sometimes phototherapy is done after the application of a medication that makes skin cells more sensitive to light (photodynamic therapy). Healthy cells regenerate quickly, but cancer cells do not.\n    Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses beams of energy to kill cancer cells. If you have one area of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, standard radiation therapy with X-rays might be recommended. For people with more areas of cancer, radiation therapy might be done with electron beams, which target the skin and don't affect internal organs. Electron beam radiation is usually applied to all of the skin.\n    Medications. Medications used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma include treatments to control the immune system, such as steroid drugs and interferon. Chemotherapy medicines attack quickly growing cells, including cancer cells. Targeted therapy medicines attack cancer cells by targeting the cells' specific vulnerabilities.\n    Exposing blood cells to light. A procedure called extracorporeal photopheresis involves taking a medicine that makes your cells more sensitive to light. Then your blood is filtered through a machine that exposes it to ultraviolet light before returning the blood to your body.\n    Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow from a matched donor (allogeneic bone marrow transplant). During a transplant you'll receive chemotherapy drugs to suppress your diseased bone marrow. Then healthy donor cells are infused into your body where they travel to your bones and begin rebuilding your bone marrow.\nMore InformationCutaneous T-cell lymphoma care at Mayo ClinicChemotherapyRadiation therapy\n        \n            \n    "},

Some strains of cryptosporidium can cause more serious disease.\nThese parasites then travel to your intestinal tract, where they settle into the walls of your intestines. Eventually, more cells are produced and are shed in massive quantities into your feces, where they are highly contagious.\nYou can become infected with cryptosporidia by touching anything that has come in contact with contaminated feces. You can get infected by:\n\n    Drinking contaminated water that contains cryptosporidium parasites\n    Swimming in contaminated water that contains cryptosporidium parasites and accidentally swallowing some of it\n    Eating uncooked, contaminated food that contains cryptosporidia\n    Touching your hand to your mouth if your hand has been in contact with a contaminated surface, object, person or animal\n\nIf you have a compromised immune system from HIV/AIDS, you're more susceptible to illness from cryptosporidium parasites than is a person with a healthy immune system. People with HIV/AIDS can develop severe symptoms and a chronic, persistent form of disease that can be difficult to treat.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Hardy parasitesCryptosporidium parasites are one of the more common causes of infectious diarrhea in humans. This parasite is difficult to to get rid of because it's resistant to many disinfectants and many filters don't remove it.\nCryptosporidia can survive for months at varying temperatures, though the parasite can be destroyed by boiling.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "The following tests can diagnose cryptosporidium infection:\n\n    Acid-staining test. To get cells for the analysis, your doctor might ask for a stool sample or, possibly, take a tissue sample (biopsy) from your intestine. The sample is then looked at under a microscope.\n    Stool culture. A culture of a sample of your stool can't detect cryptosporidium, but it can help rule out other bacterial pathogens.\n    Other tests. Once it's clear that your infection is caused by cryptosporidium parasites, you might need further testing to check for complications. For example, checking liver and gallbladder function might determine whether the infection has spread.\nMore InformationLiver function tests\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Most healthy people with cryptosporidiosis recover within two weeks without treatment.\nIf you have a compromised immune system, the treatment goal is to relieve symptoms and improve your immune response. Cryptosporidiosis treatment options include:\n\n    Anti-parasitic drugs. Medications such as nitazoxanide (Alinia) can help relieve diarrhea by attacking the parasites. Azithromycin (Zithromax) may be given with one of these medications in people with compromised immune systems.\n    Anti-motility agents. These medications slow the movements of your intestines and increase fluid absorption to relieve diarrhea and restore normal stools. Anti-motility drugs include loperamide and its derivatives (Imodium A-D, others). Talk with your doctor before using these medications.\n    Fluid replacement. Persistent diarrhea can cause you to become dehydrated. You'll need either oral or intravenous replacement of fluids and electrolytes \u2014 minerals, such as sodium, potassium and calcium, that maintain the balance of fluids in your body.\n    Antiretroviral therapies. If you have HIV/AIDS, highly active antiretroviral therapy can reduce the viral load in your body and boost your immune response.

{"Diseases": "Undescended testicle", "Symptoms": "Not seeing or feeling a testicle where you would expect it to be in the scrotum is the main sign of an undescended testicle.\nTesticles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the last couple of months of normal fetal development, the testicles gradually descend from the abdomen through a tube-like passageway in the groin (inguinal canal) into the scrotum. With an undescended testicle, that process stops or is delayed.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorAn undescended testicle is typically detected when your baby is examined shortly after birth. If your son has an undescended testicle, ask the doctor how often your son will need to be examined. If the testicle hasn't moved into the scrotum by the time your son is 4 months old, the problem probably won't correct itself.\nTreating an undescended testicle when your son is still a baby might lower the risk of complications later in life, such as infertility and testicular cancer.\nOlder boys \u2014 from infants to pre-adolescent boys \u2014 who have normally descended testicles at birth might appear to be \"missing\" a testicle later. This condition might indicate:\n\n\tA retractile testicle, which moves back and forth between the scrotum and the groin and might be easily guided by hand into the scrotum during a physical exam. This is not abnormal and is due to a muscle reflex in the scrotum.\n\tAn ascending testicle, or acquired undescended testicle, that has \"returned\" to the groin and can't be easily guided by hand into the scrotum.\n\nIf you notice any changes in your son's genitals or are concerned about his development, talk to your son's doctor.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The exact cause of an undescended testicle isn't known.

A small tube containing a camera is inserted through a small incision in your son's abdomen. Laparoscopy is done to locate an intra-abdominal testicle.\n    The doctor might be able to fix the undescended testicle during the same procedure, but an additional surgery might be needed in some cases. Alternatively, laparoscopy might show no testicle present, or a small remnant of nonfunctioning testicular tissue that is then removed.\n    \n    Open surgery. Direct exploration of the abdomen or groin through a larger incision might be necessary in some cases.\n\nAfter birth, if the doctor can't detect any testicles in the scrotum, he or she might order further testing to determine if the testicles aren't there at all rather than undescended. Some conditions that result in absent testicles can cause serious medical problems soon after birth if left undiagnosed and untreated.\nImaging tests, such as an ultrasound and MRI, generally aren't recommended for diagnosing an undescended testicle.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your undescended testicle-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationUndescended testicle care at Mayo ClinicMRIUltrasound\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "The goal of treatment is to move the undescended testicle to its proper location in the scrotum. Treatment before 1 year of age might lower the risk of complications of an undescended testicle, such as infertility and testicular cancer. Earlier is better, but it's recommended that surgery takes place before the child is 18 months old.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryAn undescended testicle is usually corrected with surgery. The surgeon carefully manipulates the testicle into the scrotum and stitches it into place (orchiopexy). This procedure can be done either with a laparoscope or with open surgery.\nWhen your son has surgery will depend on a number of factors, such as his health and how difficult the procedure might be. Your surgeon will likely recommend doing the surgery when your son is about 6 months old and before he is 12 months old. Early surgical treatment appears to lower the risk of later complications.\nIn some cases, the testicle might be poorly developed, abnormal or dead tissue. The surgeon will remove this testicular tissue.\nIf your son also has an inguinal hernia associated with the undescended testicle, the hernia is repaired during the surgery.\nAfter surgery, the surgeon will monitor the testicle to see that it continues to develop, function properly and stay in place. Monitoring might include:\n\n    Physical exams\n    Ultrasound exams of the scrotum\n    Tests of hormone levels\n\n        \n            \n            Hormone treatmentHormone treatment involves the injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). This hormone could cause the testicle to move to your son's scrotum. Hormone treatment is not usually recommended because it is much less effective than surgery.\n        \n            \n            Other treatmentsIf your son doesn't have one or both testicles \u2014 because one or both are missing or didn't survive after surgery \u2014 you might consider saline testicular prostheses for the scrotum that can be implanted during late childhood or adolescence. These prostheses give the scrotum a normal appearance.\nIf your son doesn't have at least one healthy testicle, your child's doctor will refer him to a hormone specialist (endocrinologist) to discuss future hormone treatments that would be necessary to bring about puberty and physical maturity.\n        \n            \n            ResultsOrchiopexy, the most common surgical procedure for correcting a single descending testicle, has a success rate of nearly 100 percent.

Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate, but don't cause, Crohn's disease. Several factors, such as heredity and a malfunctioning immune system, likely play a role in its development.\n\n    Immune system. It's possible that a virus or bacterium may trigger Crohn's disease; however, scientists have yet to identify such a trigger. When your immune system tries to fight off the invading microorganism, an abnormal immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too.\n    Heredity. Crohn's is more common in people who have family members with the disease, so genes may play a role in making people more susceptible. However, most people with Crohn's disease don't have a family history of the disease.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will likely diagnose Crohn's disease only after ruling out other possible causes for your signs and symptoms. There is no single test to diagnose Crohn's disease.\nYour doctor will likely use a combination of tests to help confirm a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, including:\n        \n            \n            Lab tests\n    Blood tests. Your doctor may suggest blood tests to check for anemia \u2014 a condition in which there aren't enough red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your tissues \u2014 or to check for signs of infection.\n    Stool studies. You may need to provide a stool sample so that your doctor can test for hidden (occult) blood or organisms, such as parasites, in your stool.\n\n        \n            \n            Procedures\n    Colonoscopy. This test allows your doctor to view your entire colon and the very end of your ileum (terminal ileum) using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a camera at the end. During the procedure, your doctor can also take small samples of tissue (biopsy) for laboratory analysis, which may help to make a diagnosis. Clusters of inflammatory cells called granulomas, if present, help essentially confirm the diagnosis of Crohn's.\n    Computerized tomography (CT). You may have a CT scan \u2014 a special X-ray technique that provides more detail than a standard X-ray does. This test looks at the entire bowel as well as at tissues outside the bowel. CT enterography is a special CT scan that provides better images of the small bowel. This test has replaced barium X-rays in many medical centers.\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI scanner uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues. MRI is particularly useful for evaluating a fistula around the anal area (pelvic MRI) or the small intestine (MR enterography).\n    \n    Capsule endoscopy. For this test, you swallow a capsule that has a camera in it. The camera takes pictures of your small intestine and transmits them to a recorder you wear on your belt. The images are then downloaded to a computer, displayed on a monitor and checked for signs of Crohn's disease. The camera exits your body painlessly in your stool.\n    You may still need endoscopy with biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Capsule endoscopy should not be performed if there is a bowel obstruction.\n    \n    Balloon-assisted enteroscopy. For this test, a scope is used in conjunction with a device called an overtube. This enables the doctor to look further into the small bowel where standard endoscopes don't reach. This technique is useful when capsule endoscopy shows abnormalities but the diagnosis is still in question.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Crohn's disease-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationCrohn's disease care at Mayo ClinicBarium enemaCapsule endoscopyColonoscopyCT scanFecal occult blood testFlexible sigmoidoscopyMRIShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "There is currently no cure for Crohn's disease, and there is no single treatment that works for everyone. One goal of medical treatment is to reduce the inflammation that triggers your signs and symptoms. Another goal is to improve long-term prognosis by limiting complications. In the best cases, this may lead not only to symptom relief but also to long-term remission.\n        \n            \n            Anti-inflammatory drugsAnti-inflammatory drugs are often the first step in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. They include:\n\n    \n    Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids such as prednisone and budesonide (Entocort EC) can help reduce inflammation in your body, but they don't work for everyone with Crohn's disease. Doctors generally use them only if you don't respond to other treatments.\n    Corticosteroids may be used for short-term (three to four months) symptom improvement and to induce remission. Corticosteroids may also be used in combination with an immune system suppressor.\n    \n    Oral 5-aminosalicylates. These drugs include sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), which contains sulfa, and mesalamine (Asacol HD, Delzicol, others). Oral 5-aminosalicylates have been widely used in the past but now are generally considered of very limited benefit.\n\n        \n            \n            Immune system suppressorsThese drugs also reduce inflammation, but they target your immune system, which produces the substances that cause inflammation. For some people, a combination of these drugs works better than one drug alone.\nImmune system suppressors include:\n\n    Azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) and mercaptopurine (Purinethol, Purixan). These are the most widely used immunosuppressants for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Taking them requires that you follow up closely with your doctor and have your blood checked regularly to look for side effects, such as a lowered resistance to infection and inflammation of the liver. They may also cause nausea and vomiting.\n    Methotrexate (Trexall). This drug is sometimes used for people with Crohn's disease who don't respond well to other medications. You will need to be followed closely for side effects.\n\n        \n            \n            BiologicsThis class of therapies targets proteins made by the immune system. Types of biologics used to treat Crohn's disease include:\n\n    \n    Natalizumab (Tysabri) and vedolizumab (Entyvio). These drugs work by stopping certain immune cell molecules \u2014 integrins \u2014 from binding to other cells in your intestinal lining. Because natalizumab is associated with a rare but serious risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \u2014 a brain disease that usually leads to death or severe disability \u2014 you must be enrolled in a special restricted distribution program to use it.\n    Vedolizumab recently was approved for Crohn's disease. It works like natalizumab but appears not to carry a risk of brain disease.\n    \n    Infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira) and certolizumab pegol (Cimzia). Also known as TNF inhibitors, these drugs work by neutralizing an immune system protein known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF).\n    Ustekinumab (Stelara). This was recently approved to treat Crohn's disease by interfering with the action of an interleukin, which is a protein involved in inflammation.\n\n        \n            \n            AntibioticsAntibiotics can reduce the amount of drainage from fistulas and abscesses and sometimes heal them in people with Crohn's disease. Some researchers also think that antibiotics help reduce harmful intestinal bacteria that may play a role in activating the intestinal immune system, leading to inflammation. Frequently prescribed antibiotics include ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and metronidazole (Flagyl).\n        \n            \n            Other medicationsIn addition to controlling inflammation, some medications may help relieve your signs and symptoms, but always talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medications. Depending on the severity of your Crohn's disease, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following:\n\n    Anti-diarrheals. A fiber supplement, such as psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel), can help relieve mild to moderate diarrhea by adding bulk to your stool. For more severe diarrhea, loperamide (Imodium A-D) may be effective.\n    Pain relievers. For mild pain, your doctor may recommend acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) \u2014 but not other common pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). These drugs are likely to make your symptoms worse and can make your disease worse as well.\n    Vitamins and supplements. If you're not absorbing enough nutrients, your doctor may recommend vitamins and nutritional supplements.\n\n        \n            \n            Nutrition therapyYour doctor may recommend a special diet given by mouth or a feeding tube (enteral nutrition) or nutrients infused into a vein (parenteral nutrition) to treat your Crohn's disease. This can improve your overall nutrition and allow the bowel to rest. Bowel rest can reduce inflammation in the short term.\nYour doctor may use nutrition therapy short term and combine it with medications, such as immune system suppressors. Enteral and parenteral nutrition are typically used to get people healthier prior to surgery or when other medications fail to control symptoms.\nYour doctor may also recommend a low residue or low-fiber diet to reduce the risk of intestinal blockage if you have a narrowed bowel (stricture). A low residue diet is designed to reduce the size and number of your stools.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryIf diet and lifestyle changes, drug therapy, or other treatments don't relieve your signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend surgery. Nearly half of those with Crohn's disease will require at least one surgery. However, surgery does not cure Crohn's disease.\nDuring surgery, your surgeon removes a damaged portion of your digestive tract and then reconnects the healthy sections. Surgery may also be used to close fistulas and drain abscesses.\nThe benefits of surgery for Crohn's disease are usually temporary. The disease often recurs, frequently near the reconnected tissue. The best approach is to follow surgery with medication to minimize the risk of recurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

They can develop externally in the skin and may appear as a group of red lines.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile some varieties of scleroderma occur rapidly, signs and symptoms of limited scleroderma usually develop gradually. They include:\n\nTight, hardened skin. In limited scleroderma, skin changes typically affect only the lower arms and legs, including fingers and toes, and sometimes the face and neck. Skin can look shiny from being pulled taut over underlying bone. It may become difficult to bend your fingers or to open your mouth.\nRaynaud's phenomena. This condition occurs when small blood vessels in your fingers and toes spasm in response to cold or emotional stress, blocking the flow of blood. In most people, the skin turns white before becoming blue, cold and numb.\n\nWhen circulation improves, the skin usually reddens and might throb or tingle. Raynaud's phenomena is often the first sign of limited scleroderma, but many people who have Raynaud's never develop scleroderma.\nRed spots or lines on skin. The swelling of tiny blood vessels near the skin's surface cause these small red spots or lines (telangiectasias). Not painful, they occur primarily on the hands and face.\nBumps under the skin. Limited scleroderma can cause tiny calcium deposits (calcinosis) to develop under your skin, mainly on your elbows, knees and fingers. You can see and feel these deposits, which sometimes are tender or become infected.\nSwallowing difficulties. Limited scleroderma commonly causes problems with the tube that connects the mouth and stomach (esophagus). Poor functioning of the muscles in the upper and lower esophagus can make swallowing difficult and allow stomach acids to back up into the esophagus, leading to heartburn, inflammation and scarring of esophageal tissues.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nEarly detection of limited scleroderma can help prevent serious complications. See your doctor if you have any indications of the condition.\n\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The cause isn't known, but limited scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disorder, in which your immune system turns against your body. The immune system appears to stimulate the production of too much collagen, a key component of connective tissue. This overproduction of collagen builds up in the skin and internal organs so that they don't function normally.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Like other unusual and complex autoimmune disorders, limited scleroderma can be difficult to diagnose. Signs and symptoms vary widely and often resemble those of other diseases.\n\nThe diagnosis of limited scleroderma is generally made based on your signs and symptoms. During the physical exam, your doctor will look for changes in the texture, color and appearance of your skin. Tests that might aid in the diagnosis include:\n\nLab tests. A sample of your blood can be tested for antibodies that are frequently found in the blood of people with limited scleroderma. But this isn't a definitive test because not everyone with limited scleroderma has these antibodies.\nSkin biopsy. Sometimes doctors take a small sample of skin that's examined under a microscope in a laboratory. Although biopsies can be helpful, they can't definitively diagnose limited scleroderma.\n\nYour doctor might recommend additional tests to identify lung, heart, kidney or gastrointestinal complications.\nMore InformationSkin biopsy\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Limited scleroderma has no known cure. Treatment focuses on relieving signs and symptoms and preventing complications.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsSeveral types of medications can help ease the signs and symptoms of limited scleroderma, including:\n\nTopical antibiotics. If skin ulcers become infected, you might need to apply topical antibiotics and bandage the area. If topical treatment doesn't work, you might need oral or intravenous antibiotics.\nAntacid drugs. For heartburn, your doctor might suggest drugs that reduce the production of stomach acid.\nBlood pressure lowering drugs. Medications that open small blood vessels and increase circulation might help relieve Raynaud's symptoms and reduce increased pressure in the arteries between the heart, lungs and kidney.\nDrugs to suppress the immune system. These types of medications have shown promise in preventing a condition in which excess collagen collects in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs.\n\n\n        \n            \n            TherapyStiff, painful joints and skin are common problems in limited scleroderma. Physical or occupational therapy can teach exercises to help you maintain your flexibility and strength.\n\nPhysical therapy. Stretching exercises are important to help prevent loss of mobility in your finger joints. A physical therapist can also show you facial exercises that can help keep your face and mouth flexible.\nOccupational therapy. If needed, an occupational therapist can help you learn new ways of performing daily tasks. For example, special toothbrushes and flossing devices can make it easier for you to care for your teeth.\n\n        \n            \n            SurgerySurgery might be necessary for certain problems, such as:\n\nCalcium deposits. Large or painful calcium deposits are sometimes surgically removed.\nRed spots or lines. Laser surgery can reduce the appearance of red spots or lines caused by swollen blood vessels near the surface of the skin.\nMore InformationBiofeedback\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

{"Diseases": "Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)", "Symptoms": "Persistent depressive disorder symptoms usually come and go over a period of years, and their intensity can change over time. But typically symptoms don't disappear for more than two months at a time. In addition, major depression episodes may occur before or during persistent depressive disorder \u2014 this is sometimes called double depression.\nSymptoms of persistent depressive disorder can cause significant impairment and may include:\n\n    Loss of interest in daily activities\n    Sadness, emptiness or feeling down\n    Hopelessness\n    Tiredness and lack of energy\n    Low self-esteem, self-criticism or feeling incapable\n    Trouble concentrating and trouble making decisions\n    Irritability or excessive anger\n    Decreased activity, effectiveness and productivity\n    Avoidance of social activities\n    Feelings of guilt and worries over the past\n    Poor appetite or overeating\n    Sleep problems\n\nIn children, symptoms of persistent depressive disorder may include depressed mood and irritability.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorBecause these feelings have gone on for such a long time, you may think they'll always be part of your life. But if you have any symptoms of persistent depressive disorder, seek medical help.\nTalk to your primary care doctor about your symptoms. Or seek help directly from a mental health professional. If you're reluctant to see a mental health professional, reach out to someone else who may be able to help guide you to treatment, whether it's a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.\nIf you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The exact cause of persistent depressive disorder isn't known. As with major depression, it may involve more than one cause, such as:\n\n    Biological differences. People with persistent depressive disorder may have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but they may eventually help pinpoint causes.\n    Brain chemistry. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression. Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment.\n    Inherited traits. Persistent depressive disorder appears to be more common in people whose blood relatives also have the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression.\n    Life events. As with major depression, traumatic events such as the loss of a loved one, financial problems or a high level of stress can trigger persistent depressive disorder in some people\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "If your doctor suspects you have persistent depressive disorder, exams and tests may include:\n\n    Physical exam. The doctor may do a physical exam and ask in-depth questions about your health to determine what may be causing your depression. In some cases, it may be linked to an underlying physical health problem.\n    Lab tests. Your doctor may order lab tests to rule out other medical conditions that may cause depressive symptoms. For example, your doctor may order a blood test to find out if your thyroid is underactive (hypothyroidism).\n    Psychological evaluation. This includes discussing your thoughts, feelings and behavior and it may include a questionnaire to help pinpoint a diagnosis. This evaluation can help determine if you have persistent depressive disorder or another condition that can affect mood, such as major depression, bipolar disorder or seasonal affective disorder.\n\nFor a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder, the main indication for an adult differs somewhat from that of a child:\n\n    For an adult, depressed mood occurs most of the day for two or more years\n    For a child, depressed mood or irritability occurs most of the day for at least one year \n\nSymptoms caused by persistent depressive disorder can vary from person to person. When persistent depressive disorder starts before age 21, it's called early onset; if it starts at age 21 or older, it's called late onset.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "The two main treatments for persistent depressive disorder are medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy). The treatment approach your doctor recommends depends on factors such as:\n\n    Severity of your symptoms\n    Your desire to address emotional or situational issues affecting your life\n    Your personal preferences\n    Previous treatment methods\n    Your ability to tolerate medications\n    Other emotional problems you may have\n\nPsychotherapy may be the first recommendation for children and adolescents with persistent depressive disorder, but that depends on the individual. Sometimes antidepressants are also needed.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsThe types of antidepressants most commonly used to treat persistent depressive disorder include:\n\n    Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n    Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)\n    Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist about possible side effects.\n        \n            \n            Finding the right medicationYou may need to try several medications or a combination before you find one that works. This requires patience, as some medications take several weeks or longer for full effect and for side effects to ease as your body adjusts.\nDon't stop taking an antidepressant without talking to your doctor \u2014 your doctor can help you gradually and safely decrease your dose. Stopping treatment abruptly or missing several doses may cause withdrawal-like symptoms, and quitting suddenly may cause a sudden worsening of depression.\nWhen you have persistent depressive disorder, you may need to take antidepressants long term to keep symptoms under control\n        \n            \n            Antidepressants and pregnancyIf you're pregnant or breast-feeding, some antidepressants may pose an increased health risk to your unborn baby or nursing child. Talk to your doctor if you become pregnant or are planning on becoming pregnant.\n        \n            \n            FDA alert on antidepressantsAlthough antidepressants are generally safe when taken as directed, the FDA requires all antidepressants to carry a black box warning, the strictest warning for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teens and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed.\nAnyone taking an antidepressant should be watched closely for worsening depression or unusual behavior, especially when first beginning a new medication or with a change in dosage. If your teen has suicidal thoughts while taking an antidepressant, immediately contact your doctor or get emergency help.\nKeep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood.\n        \n            \n            PsychotherapyPsychotherapy is a general term for treating depression by talking about your condition and related issues with a mental health professional. Psychotherapy is also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling.\nDifferent types of psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, can be effective for persistent depressive disorder. You and your therapist can discuss which type of therapy is right for you, your goals for therapy and other issues, such as the length of treatment.\nPsychotherapy can help you:\n\n    Adjust to a crisis or other current difficulty\n    Identify issues that contribute to your depression and change behaviors that make it worse\n    Identify negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones\n    Find better ways to cope and solve problems\n    Explore relationships and experiences, and develop positive interactions with others\n    Regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life and help ease depression symptoms, such as hopelessness and anger\n    Learn to set realistic goals for your life\nMore InformationCognitive behavioral therapyPsychotherapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

This is often the result of not enough foreplay. A drop in estrogen levels after menopause or childbirth or during breast-feeding also can be a cause.\n    Certain medications are known to affect sexual desire or arousal, which can decrease lubrication and make sex painful. These include antidepressants, high blood pressure medications, sedatives, antihistamines and certain birth control pills.\n    \n    Injury, trauma or irritation. This includes injury or irritation from an accident, pelvic surgery, female circumcision or a cut made during childbirth to enlarge the birth canal (episiotomy).\n    Inflammation, infection or skin disorder. An infection in your genital area or urinary tract can cause painful intercourse. Eczema or other skin problems in your genital area also can be the problem.\n    Vaginismus. These involuntary spasms of the muscles of the vaginal wall can make penetration painful.\n    Congenital abnormality.

Changing medications known to cause lubrication problems also might eliminate your symptoms.\nFor many postmenopausal women, dyspareunia is caused by inadequate lubrication resulting from low estrogen levels. Often, this can be treated with topical estrogen applied directly to the vagina.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved the drug ospemifene (Osphena) to treat moderate to severe dyspareunia in women who have problems with vaginal lubrication. Ospemifene acts like estrogen on the vaginal lining.\nDrawbacks are that the drug might cause hot flashes, and it carries a risk of stroke, blood clots and cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrium).\nAnother drug to relieve painful intercourse is prasterone (Intrarosa).

It's best if you start when your child is 6 months old or even younger. Try listening to recorded books with your child. When your child is old enough, read the stories together after your child hears them.\n    Work with your child's school. Talk to your child's teacher about how the school will help him or her succeed. You are your child's best advocate.\n    Encourage reading time. To improve reading skills, a child must practice reading. Encourage your child to read.\n    Set an example for reading. Designate a time each day to read something of your own while your child reads \u2014 this sets an example and supports your child. Show your child that reading can be enjoyable.\n\n        \n            \n            What adults with dyslexia can doSuccess in employment can be difficult for adults struggling with dyslexia.

{"Diseases": "Dwarfism", "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms \u2014 other than short stature \u2014 vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Disproportionate dwarfismMost people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body.\nAlmost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus).\nThe most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following:\n\n    An average-size trunk\n    Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs\n    Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers\n    Limited mobility at the elbows\n    A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose\n    Progressive development of bowed legs\n    Progressive development of swayed lower back\n    An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm)\n\nAnother cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include:\n\n    A very short trunk\n    A short neck\n    Shortened arms and legs\n    Average-size hands and feet\n    Broad, rounded chest\n    Slightly flattened cheekbones\n    Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate)\n    Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward\n    A foot that's twisted or out of shape\n    Instability of the neck bones\n    Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine\n    Progressive development of swayed lower back\n    Vision and hearing problems\n    Arthritis and problems with joint movement\n    Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm)\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Proportionate dwarfismProportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems.\nGrowth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include:\n\n    Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts\n    Growth rate slower than expected for age\n    Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorSigns and symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism are often present at birth or in early infancy.

A person with achondroplasia and with two average-size parents received one mutated copy of the gene associated with the disorder and one normal copy of the gene.

In some cases, disproportionate dwarfism may be suspected during a prenatal ultrasound if very short limbs disproportionate to the trunk are noted.\nDiagnostic tests may include:\n\n    Measurements. A regular part of a well-baby medical exam is the measurement of height, weight and head circumference. At each visit, your pediatrician will plot these measurements on a chart to show your child's current percentile ranking for each one. This is important for identifying abnormal growth, such as delayed growth or a disproportionately large head. If any trends in these charts are a concern, your pediatrician may make more-frequent measurements.\n    Appearance. Many distinct facial and skeletal features are associated with each of several dwarfism disorders. Your child's appearance also may help your pediatrician to make a diagnosis.\n    Imaging technology. Your doctor may order imaging studies, such as X-rays, because certain abnormalities of the skull and skeleton can indicate which disorder your child may have. Various imaging devices may also reveal delayed maturation of bones, as is the case in growth hormone deficiency. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may reveal abnormalities of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, both of which play a role in hormone function.\n    Genetic tests. Genetic tests are available for many of the known causal genes of dwarfism-related disorders, but these tests often aren't necessary to make an accurate diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to suggest a test only to distinguish among possible diagnoses when other evidence is unclear or as a part of further family planning. If your pediatrician believes your daughter may have Turner syndrome, then a special lab test may be done that assesses the X chromosomes extracted from blood cells.\n    Family history. Your pediatrician may take a history of stature in siblings, parents, grandparents or other relatives to help determine whether the average range of height in your family includes short stature.\n    Hormone tests.

The condition usually begins as a thickening of the skin on the palm of your hand. As it progresses, the skin on your palm might appear puckered or dimpled. A firm lump of tissue can form on your palm. This lump might be sensitive to the touch but usually isn't painful.\nIn later stages of Dupuytren's contracture, cords of tissue form under the skin on your palm and can extend up to your fingers. As these cords tighten, your fingers might be pulled toward your palm, sometimes severely.\nThe two fingers farthest from the thumb are most commonly affected, though the middle finger also can be involved. Only rarely are the thumb and index finger affected.

He or she will also press on parts of your hands and fingers to check for toughened knots or bands of tissue.\nYour doctor also might check to see if you can put your hand flat on a tabletop or other flat surface. Not being able to fully flatten your fingers indicates you have Dupuytren's contracture.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "If the disease progresses slowly, causes no pain and has little impact on your ability to use your hands for everyday tasks, you might not need treatment. Instead, you can wait and see if Dupuytren's contracture progresses. You may wish to follow the progression with a tabletop test, which you can do on your own.\nTreatment involves removing or breaking apart the cords that are pulling your fingers toward your palm. This can be done in several ways. The choice of procedure depends on the severity of your symptoms and other health problems you may have.\n        \n            \n            NeedlingThis technique uses a needle, inserted through your skin, to puncture and break the cord of tissue that's contracting a finger. Contractures often recur but the procedure can be repeated.\nThe main advantages of the needling technique are that there is no incision, it can be done on several fingers at the same time, and usually very little physical therapy is needed afterward.

The main advantage to surgery is that it results in a more complete and longer-lasting release than that provided by the needle or enzyme methods. The main disadvantages are that physical therapy is usually needed after surgery, and recovery can take longer.\nIn some severe cases, especially if surgery has failed to correct the problem, surgeons remove all the tissue likely to be affected by Dupuytren's contracture, including the attached skin. In these cases a skin graft is needed to cover the open wound. This surgery is the most invasive option and has the longest recovery time.

One chromosome in each pair comes from your father, the other from your mother.\nDown syndrome results when abnormal cell division involving chromosome 21 occurs. These cell division abnormalities result in an extra partial or full chromosome 21. This extra genetic material is responsible for the characteristic features and developmental problems of Down syndrome. Any one of three genetic variations can cause Down syndrome:\n\n    Trisomy 21. About 95 percent of the time, Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 \u2014 the person has three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies, in all cells. This is caused by abnormal cell division during the development of the sperm cell or the egg cell.\n    Mosaic Down syndrome. In this rare form of Down syndrome, a person has only some cells with an extra copy of chromosome 21. This mosaic of normal and abnormal cells is caused by abnormal cell division after fertilization.\n    Translocation Down syndrome. Down syndrome can also occur when a portion of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) onto another chromosome, before or at conception. These children have the usual two copies of chromosome 21, but they also have additional genetic material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome.\n\nThere are no known behavioral or environmental factors that cause Down syndrome.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Is it inherited?Most of the time, Down syndrome isn't inherited. It's caused by a mistake in cell division during early development of the fetus.\nTranslocation Down syndrome can be passed from parent to child. However, only about 3 to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome have translocation and only some of them inherited it from one of their parents.\nWhen balanced translocations are inherited, the mother or father has some rearranged genetic material from chromosome 21 on another chromosome, but no extra genetic material. This means he or she has no signs or symptoms of Down syndrome, but can pass an unbalanced translocation on to children, causing Down syndrome in the children.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering the option of screening tests and diagnostic tests for Down syndrome to all pregnant women, regardless of age.\n\n    Screening tests can indicate the likelihood or chances that a mother is carrying a baby with Down syndrome.

This blood test measures the levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and the pregnancy hormone known as human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Abnormal levels of PAPP-A and HCG may indicate a problem with the baby.\n    Nuchal translucency test. During this test, an ultrasound is used to measure a specific area on the back of your baby's neck. This is known as a nuchal translucency screening test. When abnormalities are present, more fluid than usual tends to collect in this neck tissue.\n\nUsing your age and the results of the blood test and the ultrasound, your doctor or genetic counselor can estimate your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome.\n        \n            \n            Integrated screening testThe integrated screening test is done in two parts during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. The results are combined to estimate the risk that your baby has Down syndrome.\n\n    First trimester. Part one includes a blood test to measure PAPP-A and an ultrasound to measure nuchal translucency.\n    Second trimester. The quad screen measures your blood level of four pregnancy-associated substances: alpha fetoprotein, estriol, HCG and inhibin A.\n\n        \n            \n            Diagnostic tests during pregnancyIf your screening test results are positive or worrisome, or you're at high risk of having a baby with Down syndrome, you might consider more testing to confirm the diagnosis. Your health care provider can help you weigh the pros and cons of these tests.\nDiagnostic tests that can identify Down syndrome include:\n\n    Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). In CVS, cells are taken from the placenta and used to analyze the fetal chromosomes. This test is typically performed in the first trimester, between 10 and 13 weeks of pregnancy. The risk of pregnancy loss (miscarriage) from a CVS is very low.\n    Amniocentesis. A sample of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is withdrawn through a needle inserted into the mother's uterus. This sample is then used to analyze the chromosomes of the fetus. Doctors usually perform this test in the second trimester, after 15 weeks of pregnancy. This test also carries a very low risk of miscarriage.\n\nPreimplantation genetic diagnosis is an option for couples undergoing in vitro fertilization who are at increased risk of passing along certain genetic conditions. The embryo is tested for genetic abnormalities before it's implanted in the womb.\n        \n            \n            Diagnostic tests for newbornsAfter birth, the initial diagnosis of Down syndrome is often based on the baby's appearance. But the features associated with Down syndrome can be found in babies without Down syndrome, so your health care provider will likely order a test called a chromosomal karyotype to confirm diagnosis. Using a sample of blood, this test analyzes your child's chromosomes.

With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion.\n\n    Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed,  sit up or experience a blow to the head. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo.\n    Infection. A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis.\n    Meniere's disease.

If you have Meniere's disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes.\n    Medications that relieve dizziness and nausea. Your doctor may prescribe drugs to provide immediate relief from vertigo, dizziness and nausea, including prescription antihistamines and anticholinergics. Many of these drugs cause drowsiness.\n    Anti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness.\n    Preventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent migraine attacks.\n\n        \n            \n            Therapy\nHead position maneuvers. A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away. It can be done by your doctor, an audiologist or a physical therapist and involves maneuvering the position of your head. It's usually effective after one or two treatments. Before undergoing this procedure, tell your care provider if you have a neck or back condition, a detached retina, or blood vessel problems.\nBalance therapy. You may learn specific exercises to help make your balance system less sensitive to motion. This physical therapy technique is called vestibular rehabilitation. It is used for people with dizziness from inner ear conditions such as vestibular neuritis.\nPsychotherapy. This type of therapy may help people whose dizziness is caused by anxiety disorders.\n\n\n        \n            \n            Surgical or other procedures\nInjections. Your doctor may inject your inner ear with the antibiotic gentamicin to disable the balance function. The unaffected ear takes over that function.\nRemoval of the inner ear sense organ. A procedure that's rarely used is called labyrinthectomy. It disables the vestibular labyrinth in the affected ear. The other ear takes over the balance function. This technique may be used if you have serious hearing loss and your dizziness hasn't responded to other treatments.\n\nMore InformationCanalith repositioning procedurePsychotherapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

The surgeon removes diseased segments of your intestine and then reconnects the healthy segments (anastomosis). This allows you to have normal bowel movements. Depending on the amount of inflammation, you may have open surgery or a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure.\n    Bowel resection with colostomy. If you have so much inflammation that it's not possible to rejoin your colon and rectum, the surgeon will perform a colostomy. An opening (stoma) in your abdominal wall is connected to the healthy part of your colon. Waste passes through the opening into a bag. Once the inflammation has eased, the colostomy may be reversed and the bowel reconnected.\n\n        \n            \n            Follow-up careYour doctor may recommend colonoscopy six weeks after you recover from diverticulitis, especially if you haven't had the test in the previous year. There doesn't appear to be a direct link between diverticular disease and colon or rectal cancer. But colonoscopy \u2014 which is risky during a diverticulitis attack \u2014 can exclude colon cancer as a cause of your symptoms.\nAfter successful treatment, your doctor may recommend surgery to prevent future episodes of diverticulitis.

{"Diseases": "Dissociative disorders", "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms depend on the type of dissociative disorders you have, but may include:\n\n    Memory loss (amnesia) of certain time periods, events, people and personal information\n    A sense of being detached from yourself and your emotions\n    A perception of the people and things around you as distorted and unreal\n    A blurred sense of identity\n    Significant stress or problems in your relationships, work or other important areas of your life\n    Inability to cope well with emotional or professional stress\n    Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors\n\nThere are three major dissociative disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association:\n\n    Dissociative amnesia. The main symptom is memory loss that's more severe than normal forgetfulness and that can't be explained by a medical condition. You can't recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a traumatic time. Dissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat, or more rarely, can involve complete loss of memory about yourself. It may sometimes involve travel or confused wandering away from your life (dissociative fugue). An episode of amnesia usually occurs suddenly and may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years.\n    Dissociative identity disorder. Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder is characterized by \"switching\" to alternate identities. You may feel the presence of two or more people talking or living inside your head, and you may feel as though you're possessed by other identities. Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and characteristics, including obvious differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. People with dissociative identity disorder typically also have dissociative amnesia and often have dissociative fugue.\n    Depersonalization-derealization disorder. This involves an ongoing or episodic sense of detachment or being outside yourself \u2014 observing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance as though watching a movie (depersonalization). Other people and things around you may feel detached and foggy or dreamlike, time may be slowed down or sped up, and the world may seem unreal (derealization). You may experience depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms, which can be profoundly distressing, may last only a few moments or come and go over many years.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nSome people with dissociative disorders present in a crisis with traumatic flashbacks that are overwhelming or associated with unsafe behavior. People with these symptoms should be seen in an emergency room.\nIf you or a loved one has less urgent symptoms that may indicate a dissociative disorder, call your doctor.\nSuicidal thoughts or behavior\nIf you have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number \u2014 in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) to reach a trained counselor.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Dissociative disorders usually develop as a way to cope with trauma. The disorders most often form in children subjected to long-term physical, sexual or emotional abuse or, less often, a home environment that's frightening or highly unpredictable. The stress of war or natural disasters also can bring on dissociative disorders.\nPersonal identity is still forming during childhood. So a child is more able than an adult to step outside of himself or herself and observe trauma as though it's happening to a different person. A child who learns to dissociate in order to endure a traumatic experience may use this coping mechanism in response to stressful situations throughout life.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis usually involves assessment of symptoms and ruling out any medical condition that could cause the symptoms. Testing and diagnosis often involves a referral to a mental health professional to determine your diagnosis.\nEvaluation may include:\n\n    Physical exam. Your doctor examines you, asks in-depth questions, and reviews your symptoms and personal history. Certain tests may eliminate physical conditions \u2014 for example, head injury, certain brain diseases, sleep deprivation or intoxication \u2014 that can cause symptoms such as memory loss and a sense of unreality.\n    Psychiatric exam. Your mental health professional asks questions about your thoughts, feelings, and behavior and discusses your symptoms. With your permission, information from family members or others may be helpful.\n    Diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5. Your mental health professional may compare your symptoms to the criteria for diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nFor diagnosis of dissociative disorders, the DSM-5 lists these criteria.\n        \n            \n            Dissociative amnesiaFor dissociative amnesia:\n\n    You've had one or more episodes in which you couldn't remember important personal information \u2014 usually something traumatic or stressful \u2014 or you can't remember your identity or life history. This memory loss is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.\n    Your episodes of memory loss don't occur only during the course of another mental health disorder, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Also, your symptoms are not due to alcohol or other drugs, and they're not caused by a neurological or other medical condition, such as amnesia related to head trauma.\n    You may also experience dissociative fugue, where you purposefully travel or experience confused wandering that involves amnesia \u2014 inability to remember your identity or other important personal information.\n    Your symptoms cause you significant stress or problems in your relationships, work or other important areas of your life.\n\n        \n            \n            Dissociative identity disorderFor dissociative identity disorder:\n\n    You display, or others observe, two or more distinct identities or personalities, which may be described in some cultures as possession that is unwanted and involuntary. Each identity has its own pattern of perceiving, relating to and thinking about yourself and the world.\n    You have recurrent gaps in memory for everyday events, skills, important personal information and traumatic events that are too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.\n    Your symptoms are not a part of broadly accepted cultural or religious practice.\n    Your symptoms are not due to alcohol or other drugs, or a medical condition. In children, symptoms are not due to imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.\n    Your symptoms cause you significant stress or problems in your relationships, work or other important areas of your life.\n\n        \n            \n            Depersonalization-derealization disorderFor depersonalization-derealization disorder:\n\n    You have persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached from yourself, as if you're an outside observer of your thoughts, sensations, actions or your body (depersonalization). Or you feel detached or experience a lack of reality for your surroundings as if you're in a dream or the world is distorted (derealization).\n    While you're experiencing an episode of depersonalization or derealization, you're aware the experience is not reality.\n    Your symptoms do not occur only during the course of another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia or panic disorder, or during another dissociative disorder. Your symptoms are also not explained by the direct effects of alcohol or other drugs, or a medical condition, such as temporal lobe epilepsy.\n    Your symptoms cause you significant stress or problems in your relationships, work or other important areas of your life.\n\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Dissociative disorders treatment may vary based on the type of disorder you have, but generally include psychotherapy and medication.\n        \n            \n            PsychotherapyPsychotherapy is the primary treatment for dissociative disorders. This form of therapy, also known as talk therapy, counseling or psychosocial therapy, involves talking about your disorder and related issues with a mental health professional. Look for a therapist with advanced training or experience in working with people who have experienced trauma.\nYour therapist will work to help you understand the cause of your condition and to form new ways of coping with stressful circumstances. Over time, your therapist may help you talk more about the trauma you experienced, but generally only when you have the coping skills and relationship with your therapist to safely have these conversations.\n        \n            \n            MedicationAlthough there are no medications that specifically treat dissociative disorders, your doctor may prescribe antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications or antipsychotic drugs to help control the mental health symptoms associated with dissociative disorders.More InformationCognitive behavioral therapyHypnosisPsychotherapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

It might involve:\n\n    Reduction. Your doctor might try gentle maneuvers to help your bones back into position. Depending on the amount of pain and swelling, you might need a local anesthetic or even a general anesthetic before manipulation of your bones.\n    Immobilization. After your bones are back in position, your doctor might immobilize your joint with a splint or sling for several weeks.

Some of the causes of esophageal dysphagia include:\n\n    Achalasia. When your lower esophageal muscle (sphincter) doesn't relax properly to let food enter your stomach, it may cause you to bring food back up into your throat. Muscles in the wall of your esophagus may be weak as well, a condition that tends to worsen over time.\n    Diffuse spasm. This condition produces multiple high-pressure, poorly coordinated contractions of your esophagus, usually after you swallow. Diffuse spasm affects the involuntary muscles in the walls of your lower esophagus.\n    Esophageal stricture. A narrowed esophagus (stricture) can trap large pieces of food. Tumors or scar tissue, often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can cause narrowing.\n    Esophageal tumors. Difficulty swallowing tends to get progressively worse when esophageal tumors are present.\n    Foreign bodies. Sometimes food or another object can partially block your throat or esophagus. Older adults with dentures and people who have difficulty chewing their food may be more likely to have a piece of food become lodged in the throat or esophagus.\n    Esophageal ring. A thin area of narrowing in the lower esophagus can intermittently cause difficulty swallowing solid foods.\n    GERD. Damage to esophageal tissues from stomach acid backing up into your esophagus can lead to spasm or scarring and narrowing of your lower esophagus.\n    Eosinophilic esophagitis. This condition, which may be related to a food allergy, is caused by an overpopulation of cells called eosinophils in the esophagus.\n    Scleroderma. Development of scar-like tissue, causing stiffening and hardening of tissues, can weaken your lower esophageal sphincter, allowing acid to back up into your esophagus and cause frequent heartburn.\n    Radiation therapy. This cancer treatment can lead to inflammation and scarring of the esophagus.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Oropharyngeal dysphagiaCertain conditions can weaken your throat muscles, making it difficult to move food from your mouth into your throat and esophagus when you start to swallow. You may choke, gag or cough when you try to swallow or have the sensation of food or fluids going down your windpipe (trachea) or up your nose. This may lead to pneumonia.\nCauses of oropharyngeal dysphagia include:\n\n    Neurological disorders. Certain disorders \u2014 such as multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson's disease \u2014 can cause dysphagia.\n    Neurological damage. Sudden neurological damage, such as from a stroke or brain or spinal cord injury, can affect your ability to swallow.\n    Pharyngoesophageal diverticulum (Zenker's diverticulum). A small pouch that forms and collects food particles in your throat, often just above your esophagus, leads to difficulty swallowing, gurgling sounds, bad breath, and repeated throat clearing or coughing.\n    Cancer. Certain cancers and some cancer treatments, such as radiation, can cause difficulty swallowing.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will likely perform a physical examination and may use a variety of tests to determine the cause of your swallowing problem.\nTests may include:\n\n    \n    X-ray with a contrast material (barium X-ray). You drink a barium solution that coats your esophagus, allowing it to show up better on X-rays. Your doctor can then see changes in the shape of your esophagus and can assess the muscular activity.\n    Your doctor may also have you swallow solid food or a pill coated with barium to watch the muscles in your throat as you swallow or to look for blockages in your esophagus that the liquid barium solution may not identify.\n    \n    Dynamic swallowing study. You swallow barium-coated foods of different consistencies. This test provides an image of these foods as they travel through your mouth and down your throat. The images may show problems in the coordination of your mouth and throat muscles when you swallow and determine whether food is going into your breathing tube.\n    A visual examination of your esophagus (endoscopy). A thin, flexible lighted instrument (endoscope) is passed down your throat so that your doctor can see your esophagus. Your doctor may also take biopsies of the esophagus to look for inflammation, eosinophilic esophagitis, narrowing or a tumor.\n    Fiber-optic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Your doctor may examine your throat with a special camera and lighted tube (endoscope) as you try to swallow.\n    Esophageal muscle test (manometry). In manometry (muh-NOM-uh-tree), a small tube is inserted into your esophagus and connected to a pressure recorder to measure the muscle contractions of your esophagus as you swallow.\n    Imaging scans.

For a tight esophageal sphincter (achalasia) or an esophageal stricture, your doctor may use an endoscope with a special balloon attached to gently stretch and expand the width of your esophagus or pass a flexible tube or tubes to stretch the esophagus (dilation).\n    Surgery. For an esophageal tumor, achalasia or pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, you may need surgery to clear your esophageal path.\n    Medications. Difficulty swallowing associated with GERD can be treated with prescription oral medications to reduce stomach acid. You may need to take these medications for an extended period. If you have eosinophilic esophagitis, you may need corticosteroids. If you have esophageal spasm, smooth muscle relaxants may help.\n\n        \n            \n            Severe dysphagiaIf difficulty swallowing prevents you from eating and drinking adequately, your doctor may recommend:\n\n    A special liquid diet. This may help you maintain a healthy weight and avoid dehydration.\n    A feeding tube. In severe cases of dysphagia, you may need a feeding tube to bypass the part of your swallowing mechanism that isn't working normally.\n\n        \n            \n            SurgerySurgery may be recommended to relieve swallowing problems caused by throat narrowing or blockages, including bony outgrowths, vocal cord paralysis, pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, GERD and achalasia, or to treat esophageal cancer. Speech and swallowing therapy is usually helpful after surgery.\nThe type of surgical treatment depends on the cause for dysphagia. Some examples are:\n\n    Laparoscopic Heller myotomy, which is used to cut the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus (sphincter) when it fails to open and release food into the stomach in people who have achalasia.\n    Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). The surgeon uses an endoscope inserted through your mouth and down your throat to create an incision in the inside lining of your esophagus. Then, as in a Heller myotomy, the surgeon cuts the muscle at the lower end of the esophageal sphincter.\n    Esophageal dilation. Your doctor inserts a lighted tube (endoscope) into your esophagus and inflates an attached balloon to gently stretch and expand its width (dilation). This treatment is used for a tight sphincter muscle at the end of the esophagus (achalasia), a narrowing of the esophagus (esophageal stricture), an abnormal ring of tissue located at the junction of the esophagus and stomach (Schatzki's ring) or a motility disorder.

{"Diseases": "Voice disorders", "Symptoms": "", "Causes": "Your voice box (larynx) is made of cartilage, muscle and mucous membranes located at the top of your windpipe (trachea) and the base of your tongue. Your vocal cords are two flexible bands of muscle tissue that sit at the entrance of the windpipe. Sound is created when your vocal cords vibrate.\nThis vibration comes from air moving through the larynx, bringing your vocal cords closer together. Your vocal cords also help close your voice box when you swallow, preventing you from inhaling food or liquid.\nIf your vocal cords become inflamed, develop growths or become paralyzed, they can't work properly, and you may develop a voice disorder.\nSome common voice disorders include:\n\n    Laryngitis\n    Muscle tension dysphonia\n    Neurological voice disorders, such as spasmodic dysphonia\n    Polyps, nodules or cysts on the vocal cords (noncancerous lesions)\n    Precancerous and cancerous lesions\n    Vocal cord paralysis or weakness\n    White patches called leukoplakia\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you detailed questions about your voice problems and examine you thoroughly.

Your doctor inserts a long, rigid instrument with an angled mirror, similar to a dental mirror, into your mouth.\n    Flexible laryngoscope. Your doctor inserts a flexible tube containing a light and camera through your nose.\n    Rigid laryngoscope. Your doctor inserts a rigid viewing tube through your mouth.\n    Videostroboscope. Your doctor inserts a camera that is combined with a flashing light into your mouth to provide a slow-motion view of your vocal cords as they move.\n\nAdditional tests are sometimes used:\n\n    Sound (acoustic) analysis. Using computer analysis, your doctor can measure irregularities in the sound produced by the vocal cords.\n    Laryngeal electromyography.

Like any other part of the body, the vocal cords need regular rest and fluids. Speech pathology specialists can teach you how to use your voice more efficiently through voice therapy, how to properly clear your throat and how much liquid to drink.\n    Allergy treatments. If an allergy is creating too much mucus in your throat, your doctor or an allergy specialist can identify the allergy's cause and provide treatment.\n    Smoking cessation. If your voice problem is the result of smoking, quitting smoking can help improve your voice along with many other areas of your health, such as boosting your heart health and lowering your cancer risk.\n    Medications. Several medications are available for treating voice disorders. Depending on the cause of your voice disorder, you may need medication to reduce inflammation, treat gastroesophageal reflux or prevent blood vessel regrowth.

Your doctor can remove noncancerous, precancerous and cancerous lesions \u2014 including recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and white patches (leukoplakia) \u2014 using microsurgery, carbon dioxide laser surgery and, when appropriate, the newest laser treatments, including potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser treatment.\n    KTP laser treatment is a state-of-the-art therapy that treats lesions on the vocal cords. It treats a lesion by cutting off the blood supply to the lesion, allowing the lesion to be removed while preserving the maximum amount of underlying tissue.\n    \n    Botox injections. Injections of tiny amounts of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) into the skin on your neck may be done in some cases. These injections can decrease muscle spasms or abnormal movements if you have a neurological movement disorder that affects the vocal muscles of the larynx (spasmodic dysphonia).\n\nSometimes one vocal cord may stop moving (become paralyzed). If you have one paralyzed vocal cord, you might often complain of hoarseness. You might also complain of choking when you drink liquids, but rarely have trouble swallowing solid foods. Sometimes the problem goes away with time.\nIf the problem persists, your doctor may conduct one of several procedures. These procedures can push the paralyzed vocal cord closer to the middle of the windpipe so that the vocal cords can meet and vibrate closer together. This improves the voice and allows the larynx to close when you swallow.\nTreatments include:\n\n    Bulk injection. Body fat, collagen, hyaluronic gel or another approved filler substance is injected, either through your mouth or the skin on your neck, to add bulk to the paralyzed vocal cord or to treat vocal cord weakness. The material fills the space next to your vocal cord and pushes it closer to your other vocal cord, allowing them to vibrate more closely together.\n    Thyroplasty. A small opening is created in the cartilage from the outside of your voice box. The doctor inserts an implant through the opening and pushes it against the paralyzed vocal cord, moving it closer to your other vocal cord.\n    Replacing the damaged nerve (reinnervation). In this procedure, a healthy nerve is moved from a different area of your neck to replace the damaged vocal cord. Your voice may improve in six to nine months. Some doctors combine this procedure with a bulk injection.\n\nRead more about vocal cord paralysis treatment and allergies at Mayo Clinic.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

Tiny bulges protrude from the vessel walls, sometimes leaking or oozing fluid and blood into the retina. Tissues in the retina may swell, producing white spots in the retina. As diabetic retinopathy progresses, new blood vessels may grow and threaten your vision.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver time, too much sugar in your blood can lead to the blockage of the tiny blood vessels that nourish the retina, cutting off its blood supply. As a result, the eye attempts to grow new blood vessels. But these new blood vessels don't develop properly and can leak easily.\nThere are two types of diabetic retinopathy:\n\n    \n    Early diabetic retinopathy. In this more common form \u2014 called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) \u2014 new blood vessels aren't growing (proliferating).\n    When you have NPDR, the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken. Tiny bulges protrude from the walls of the smaller vessels, sometimes leaking fluid and blood into the retina. Larger retinal vessels can begin to dilate and become irregular in diameter as well. NPDR can progress from mild to severe as more blood vessels become blocked.\n    Sometimes retinal blood vessel damage leads to a buildup of fluid (edema) in the center portion (macula) of the retina. If macular edema decreases vision, treatment is required to prevent permanent vision loss.\n    \n    Advanced diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy can progress to this more severe type, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this type, damaged blood vessels close off, causing the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina. These new blood vessels are fragile and can leak into the clear, jellylike substance that fills the center of your eye (vitreous).\n    Eventually, scar tissue from the growth of new blood vessels can cause the retina to detach from the back of your eye. If the new blood vessels interfere with the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, pressure can build in the eyeball. This buildup can damage the nerve that carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve), resulting in glaucoma.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Diabetic retinopathy is best diagnosed with a comprehensive dilated eye exam.

They help stop growth of new blood vessels and decrease fluid buildup.\n    Two drugs are approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of diabetic macular edema \u2014 ranibizumab (Lucentis) and aflibercept (Eylea). A third drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), can be used off-label for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.\nThese drugs are injected using topical anesthesia. The injections can cause mild discomfort, such as burning, tearing or pain, for 24 hours after the injection. Possible side effects include a buildup of pressure in the eye and infection.\nThese injections will need to be repeated. In some cases, the medication is used with photocoagulation.\n    \n    Photocoagulation.

If you had blurred vision from macular edema before surgery, the treatment might not return your vision to normal, but it's likely to reduce the chance of the macular edema worsening.\n\nPanretinal photocoagulation. This laser treatment, also known as scatter laser treatment, can shrink the abnormal blood vessels. During the procedure, the areas of the retina away from the macula are treated with scattered laser burns. The burns cause the abnormal new blood vessels to shrink and scar.\nIt's usually done in your doctor's office or eye clinic in two or more sessions.

As you age, the vitreous, or jelly-like substance filling your eyeballs and helping them to maintain their round shape, changes. Over time, the vitreous partially liquefies \u2014 a process that causes it to pull away from the eyeball's interior surface. As the vitreous shrinks and sags, it clumps and gets stringy. This debris blocks some of the light passing through the eye, casting tiny shadows on your retina that are seen as floaters.\n    Inflammation in the back of the eye. Posterior uveitis is inflammation in the layers of the uvea in the back of the eye. This condition can cause the release of inflammatory debris into the vitreous that are seen as floaters. Posterior uveitis may be caused by infection, inflammatory diseases or other causes.\n    Bleeding in the eye. Bleeding into the vitreous can have many causes, including diabetes, hypertension, blocked blood vessels and injury. Blood cells are seen as floaters.\n    Torn retina. Retinal tears can occur when a sagging vitreous tugs on the retina with enough force to tear it. Without treatment, a retinal tear may lead to retinal detachment \u2014 an accumulation of fluid behind the retina that causes it to separate from the back of your eye. Untreated retinal detachment can cause permanent vision loss.\n    Eye surgeries and eye medications. Certain medications that are injected into the vitreous can cause air bubbles to form. These bubbles are seen as shadows until your eye absorbs them. Certain vitreoretinal surgeries add silicone oil bubbles into the vitreous that can also be seen as floaters.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will conduct a complete eye exam including eye dilation to better see the back of your eyes and the vitreous to determine the cause of the floaters.More InformationEye exam\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Any underlying cause of the floaters, such as bleeding from diabetes or inflammation, will be treated.

Common causes include:\n\nHormone imbalance. In a normal menstrual cycle, a balance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone regulates the buildup of the lining of the uterus (endometrium), which is shed during menstruation. If a hormone imbalance occurs, the endometrium develops in excess and eventually sheds by way of heavy menstrual bleeding.\n\nA number of conditions can cause hormone imbalances, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obesity, insulin resistance and thyroid problems.\nDysfunction of the ovaries. If your ovaries don't release an egg (ovulate) during a menstrual cycle (anovulation), your body doesn't produce the hormone progesterone, as it would during a normal menstrual cycle. This leads to hormone imbalance and may result in menorrhagia.\nUterine fibroids. These noncancerous (benign) tumors of the uterus appear during your childbearing years. Uterine fibroids may cause heavier than normal or prolonged menstrual bleeding.\nPolyps. Small, benign growths on the lining of the uterus (uterine polyps) may cause heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding.\nAdenomyosis. This condition occurs when glands from the endometrium become embedded in the uterine muscle, often causing heavy bleeding and painful periods.\nIntrauterine device (IUD). Menorrhagia is a well-known side effect of using a nonhormonal intrauterine device for birth control. Your doctor will help you plan for alternative management options.\nPregnancy complications. A single, heavy, late period may be due to a miscarriage. Another cause of heavy bleeding during pregnancy includes an unusual location of the placenta, such as a low-lying placenta or placenta previa.\nCancer. Uterine cancer and cervical cancer can cause excessive menstrual bleeding, especially if you are postmenopausal or have had an abnormal Pap test in the past.\nInherited bleeding disorders. Some bleeding disorders \u2014 such as von Willebrand's disease, a condition in which an important blood-clotting factor is deficient or impaired \u2014 can cause abnormal menstrual bleeding.\nMedications. Certain medications, including anti-inflammatory medications, hormonal medications such as estrogen and progestins, and anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) or enoxaparin (Lovenox), can contribute to heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding.\nOther medical conditions.

Then your doctor inserts a series of rods (dilators) of increasing thickness to open (dilate) your cervix and allow access to your uterus. Next, your doctor inserts a long, thin instrument (curette) through your cervix into your uterus and carefully removes the tissue lining the inside of the uterus.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nYou may need surgical treatment for menorrhagia if medical therapy is unsuccessful. Treatment options include:\n\nDilation and curettage (D&C). In this procedure, your doctor opens (dilates) your cervix and then scrapes or suctions tissue from the lining of your uterus to reduce menstrual bleeding. Although this procedure is common and often treats acute or active bleeding successfully, you may need additional D&C procedures if menorrhagia recurs.\nUterine artery embolization. For women whose menorrhagia is caused by fibroids, the goal of this procedure is to shrink any fibroids in the uterus by blocking the uterine arteries and cutting off their blood supply. During uterine artery embolization, the surgeon passes a catheter through the large artery in the thigh (femoral artery) and guides it to your uterine arteries, where the blood vessel is injected with materials that decrease blood flow to the fibroid.\nFocused ultrasound surgery. Similar to uterine artery embolization, focused ultrasound surgery treats bleeding caused by fibroids by shrinking the fibroids. This procedure uses ultrasound waves to destroy the fibroid tissue. There are no incisions required for this procedure.\nMyomectomy. This procedure involves surgical removal of uterine fibroids. Depending on the size, number and location of the fibroids, your surgeon may choose to perform the myomectomy using open abdominal surgery, through several small incisions (laparoscopically), or through the vagina and cervix (hysteroscopically).\nEndometrial ablation. This procedure involves destroying (ablating) the lining of your uterus (endometrium). The procedure uses a laser, radiofrequency or heat applied to the endometrium to destroy the tissue.\n\nAfter endometrial ablation, most women have much lighter periods. Pregnancy after endometrial ablation has many associated complications. If you have endometrial ablation, the use of reliable or permanent contraception until menopause is recommended.\nEndometrial resection. This surgical procedure uses an electrosurgical wire loop to remove the lining of the uterus. Both endometrial ablation and endometrial resection benefit women who have very heavy menstrual bleeding. Pregnancy isn't recommended after this procedure.\nHysterectomy. Hysterectomy \u2014 surgery to remove your uterus and cervix \u2014 is a permanent procedure that causes sterility and ends menstrual periods. Hysterectomy is performed under anesthesia and requires hospitalization. Additional removal of the ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy) may cause premature menopause.\n\nMany of these surgical procedures are done on an outpatient basis. Although you may need a general anesthetic, it's likely that you can go home later on the same day. An abdominal myomectomy or a hysterectomy usually requires a hospital stay.\n\nWhen menorrhagia is a sign of another condition, such as thyroid disease, treating that condition usually results in lighter periods.\nMore InformationHeavy periods: Can folic acid help?Ablation therapyDilation and curettage (D&C)Endometrial ablationHormonal IUD (Mirena)Show more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

If your partner uses topical products containing androgens, you can be affected as well, through skin-to-skin contact.\n\nOften hirsutism occurs with no identifiable cause.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Tests that measure the amount of certain hormones in your blood, including testosterone or testosterone-like hormones, might help determine whether elevated androgen levels are causing your hirsutism.\nYour doctor might also examine your abdomen and do a pelvic exam to look for masses that could indicate a tumor.More InformationCT scanUltrasound\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment of hirsutism with no sign of endocrine disorder is not necessary. For women who do need or seek treatment, it may involve treating any underlying disorder, developing a self-care routine for unwanted hair, and trying various therapies and medications.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsIf cosmetic or self-care methods of hair removal haven\u2019t worked for you, talk with your doctor about drugs that treat hirsutism. With these medications it usually takes up to six months, the average life cycle of a hair follicle, before you see a significant difference in hair growth. Options include:\n\n    Oral contraceptives. Birth control pills or other hormonal contraceptives, which contain estrogen and progestin, treat hirsutism caused by androgen production. Oral contraceptives are a common treatment for hirsutism in women who don't want to become pregnant. Possible side effects include nausea and headache.\n    \n    Anti-androgens. These types of drugs block androgens from attaching to their receptors in your body. They're sometimes prescribed after six months on oral contraceptives if the oral contraceptives aren't effective enough.\n    The most commonly used anti-androgen for treating hirsutism is spironolactone (Aldactone, CaroSpir). The results are modest and take at least six months to be noticeable. Possible side effects include menstrual irregularity. Because these drugs can cause birth defects, it's important to use contraception while taking them.\n    \n    Topical cream. Eflornithine (Vaniqa) is a prescription cream specifically for excessive facial hair in women. It's applied directly to the affected area of your face twice a day. It helps slow new hair growth but doesn't get rid of existing hair. It can be used with laser therapy to enhance the response.\n\n        \n            \n            ProceduresHair removal methods whose results may last longer than self-care methods \u2014 and which may be combined with medical therapy \u2014 include:\n\n    \n    Laser therapy. A beam of highly concentrated light (laser) is passed over your skin to damage hair follicles and prevent hair from growing (photoepilation). You might need multiple treatments. For people whose unwanted hair is black, brown or auburn, photoepilation is usually a better option than electrolysis.\n    Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of the various lasers used for this hair removal method. People with tanned or darkly pigmented skin are at increased risk of side effects from certain lasers, including a darkening or lightening of their usual skin tones, blistering, and inflammation.\n    \n    \n    Electrolysis. This treatment involves inserting a tiny needle into each hair follicle. The needle emits a pulse of electric current to damage and eventually destroy the follicle. You might need multiple treatments. For people with naturally blond or white hair, electrolysis is a better option than laser therapy.\n    Electrolysis is effective but can be painful. A numbing cream spread on your skin before treatment might reduce discomfort.\n    \nMore InformationLaser hair removal\n        \n            \n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cell to multiply quickly and to go on living when healthy cells would normally die. The result is a mass (tumor) of abnormal cells that can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. The abnormal cells can break away and spread (metastasize) throughout the body.\nIn Ewing sarcoma, the DNA changes most often affect a gene called EWSR1. If your doctor suspects that you have Ewing sarcoma, your cancer cells may be tested to look for changes in this gene.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Ewing sarcoma diagnosis usually begins with a physical exam to better understand the symptoms you or your child may be experiencing. Based on those findings other tests and procedures may be recommended.\n        \n            \n            Imaging testsImaging tests help your doctor investigate your bone symptoms, look for cancer and look for signs that the cancer has spread.\nImaging tests may include:\n\n    X-ray\n    Computerized tomography (CT)\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n    Positron emission tomography (PET)\n    Bone scan\n\n        \n            \n            Removing a sample of cells for testing (biopsy)A biopsy procedure is used to collect a sample of suspicious cells for laboratory testing. Tests can show whether the cells are cancerous and what type of cancer you have.\nTypes of biopsy procedures used to diagnose Ewing sarcoma include:\n\n    Needle biopsy. The doctor inserts a thin needle through the skin and guides it into the tumor. The needle is used to remove small pieces of tissue from the tumor.\n    Surgical biopsy. The doctor makes an incision through the skin and removes either the entire tumor (excisional biopsy) or a portion of the tumor (incisional biopsy).\n\nDetermining the type of biopsy needed and the specifics of how it should be performed requires careful planning by the medical team. Doctors need to perform the biopsy in a way that won't interfere with future surgery to remove the cancer. For this reason, ask your doctor for a referral to a team of experts with extensive experience in treating Ewing sarcoma before the biopsy.\n        \n            \n            Testing the cancer cells for gene mutationsA sample of your cancer cells will be tested in the lab to determine which DNA changes are present in the cells. Ewing sarcoma cells usually have changes in the EWSR1 gene. Most often the EWSR1 gene becomes fused with another gene called FLI1, creating a new gene called EWS-FLI1. Testing the cancer cells for these gene changes can help confirm your diagnosis and give your doctor clues about the aggressiveness of your disease.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Ewing sarcoma-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationEwing sarcoma care at Mayo ClinicBone scanCT scanMRINeedle biopsyPositron emission tomography scanShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Ewing sarcoma treatment usually begins with chemotherapy. Surgery to remove the cancer usually follows.

Chemotherapy treatment usually combines two or more drugs that can be administered as an infusion into a vein (IV), in pill form, or through both methods.\nTreatment for Ewing sarcoma usually begins with chemotherapy. The drugs may shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove the cancer with surgery or target with radiation therapy.\nAfter surgery or radiation therapy, chemotherapy treatments might continue in order to kill any cancer cells that might remain.\nFor advanced cancer that spreads to other areas of the body, chemotherapy might help relieve pain and slow the growth of the cancer.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryThe goal of surgery is to remove all of the cancer cells. But planning the operation also takes into consideration how it will affect your ability to go about your daily life.\nSurgery for Ewing sarcoma may involve removing a small portion of bone or removing an entire limb. Whether surgeons can remove all of the cancer without removing the entire limb depends on several factors, such as the size and location of the tumor and whether it shrinks after chemotherapy.\n        \n            \n            Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells.\nDuring radiation therapy, the beams of energy are delivered from a machine that moves around you as you lie on a table. The beams are carefully directed to the area of the Ewing sarcoma in order to reduce the risk of damage to surrounding healthy cells.\nRadiation therapy might be recommended after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain. It can also be used instead of surgery if the Ewing sarcoma is located in a part of the body where surgery is not possible or would result in unacceptable functional outcomes (such as loss of bowel or bladder function).\nFor advanced Ewing sarcomas, radiation therapy can slow the growth of the cancer and help relieve pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.
