But the sequence of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is clear. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors (gastrinomas) form in your pancreas or duodenum or at other sites such as the lymph nodes adjacent to your pancreas.\nYour pancreas sits behind and below your stomach. It produces enzymes that are essential to digesting food. The pancreas also produces several hormones including insulin, a hormone that helps to control your blood glucose.\nDigestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum, the part of the small intestine next to your stomach. This is where digestion reaches its peak.\nThe tumors that occur with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are made up of cells that secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Increased gastrin makes the stomach produce far too much acid. The excess acid then leads to peptic ulcers and sometimes to diarrhea.\nBesides causing excess acid production, the tumors are often cancerous (malignant). Although the tumors tend to grow slowly, the cancer can spread elsewhere \u2014 most commonly to nearby lymph nodes or your liver.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Association with MEN 1Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may be caused by an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1). People with MEN 1 also have tumors in the parathyroid glands and may have tumors in their pituitary glands.\nAbout 25% of people who have gastrinomas have them as part of Men 1. They may also have tumors in the pancreas and other organs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will base a diagnosis on the following:\n\n    Medical history. Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and review your medical history.\n    \n    Blood tests. A sample of your blood is analyzed to see whether you have elevated gastrin levels. While elevated gastrin may indicate tumors in your pancreas or duodenum, it can also be caused by other conditions. For example, gastrin may also be elevated if your stomach isn't making acid, or you're taking acid-reducing medications, such as proton pump inhibitors.\n    You need to fast before this test and may need to stop taking any acid-reducing medications to get the most accurate measure of your gastrin levels. Because gastrin levels can fluctuate, this test may be repeated a few times.\n    Your doctor may also perform a secretin stimulation test. For this test, your doctor first measures your gastrin levels, then gives you an injection of the hormone secretin and measures gastrin levels again. If you have Zollinger-Ellison, your gastrin levels will increase even more.\n    \n    Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. After you're sedated, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible instrument with a light and video camera (endoscope) down your throat and into your stomach and duodenum to look for ulcers. Through the endoscope, your doctor may remove a tissue sample (biopsy) from your duodenum to help detect the presence of gastrin-producing tumors. Your doctor will ask you not to eat anything after midnight the night before the test.\n    \n    Endoscopic ultrasound. In this procedure, your doctor examines your stomach, duodenum and pancreas with an endoscope fitted with an ultrasound probe. The probe allows for closer inspection, making it easier to spot tumors.\n    It's also possible to remove a tissue sample through the endoscope. You'll need to fast after midnight the night before this test, and you'll be sedated during the test.\n    \n    Imaging tests. Your doctor may use imaging techniques such as a nuclear scan called somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. This test uses radioactive tracers to help locate tumors. Other helpful imaging tests include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT scanning.\nMore InformationCT scanEndoscopic ultrasoundMRIUltrasoundShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome addresses the hormone-secreting tumors as well as the ulcers they cause.\n        \n            \n            Treatment of tumorsAn operation to remove the tumors that occur in Zollinger-Ellison requires a skilled surgeon because the tumors are often small and difficult to locate. If you have just one tumor, your doctor may be able to remove it surgically, but surgery may not be an option if you have multiple tumors or tumors that have spread to your liver. On the other hand, even if you have multiple tumors, your doctor still may recommend removing a single large tumor.\nIn some cases, doctors advise other treatments to control tumor growth, including:\n\n    Removing as much of a liver tumor as possible (debulking)\n    Attempting to destroy the tumor by cutting off the blood supply (embolization) or by using heat to destroy cancer cells (radiofrequency ablation)\n    Injecting drugs into the tumor to relieve cancer symptoms\n    Using chemotherapy to try to slow tumor growth\n    Having a liver transplant\n\n        \n            \n            Treatment of excess acidExcess acid production can almost always be controlled. Medications known as proton pump inhibitors are the first line of treatment. These are effective medications for decreasing acid production in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\nProton pump inhibitors are powerful drugs that reduce acid by blocking the action of the tiny \"pumps\" within acid-secreting cells. Commonly prescribed medications include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and esomeprazole (Nexium).\nLong-term use of prescription proton pump inhibitors, especially in people age 50 and older, has been associated with an increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist and spine, according to the Food and Drug Administration. This risk is small and should be weighed against the acid-blocking benefits of these medications.\nOctreotide (Sandostatin), a medication similar to the hormone somatostatin, may counteract the effects of gastrin and be helpful for some people.More InformationChemotherapyLiver transplantRadiofrequency ablation for cancer\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

These medications may mask your symptoms, which could delay your diagnosis.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The exact cause of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome remains unknown. But the sequence of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is clear. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors (gastrinomas) form in your pancreas or duodenum or at other sites such as the lymph nodes adjacent to your pancreas.\nYour pancreas sits behind and below your stomach. It produces enzymes that are essential to digesting food. The pancreas also produces several hormones including insulin, a hormone that helps to control your blood glucose.\nDigestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum, the part of the small intestine next to your stomach. This is where digestion reaches its peak.\nThe tumors that occur with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are made up of cells that secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Increased gastrin makes the stomach produce far too much acid. The excess acid then leads to peptic ulcers and sometimes to diarrhea.\nBesides causing excess acid production, the tumors are often cancerous (malignant). Although the tumors tend to grow slowly, the cancer can spread elsewhere \u2014 most commonly to nearby lymph nodes or your liver.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Association with MEN 1Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may be caused by an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1). People with MEN 1 also have tumors in the parathyroid glands and may have tumors in their pituitary glands.\nAbout 25% of people who have gastrinomas have them as part of Men 1. They may also have tumors in the pancreas and other organs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will base a diagnosis on the following:\n\n    Medical history. Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and review your medical history.\n    \n    Blood tests. A sample of your blood is analyzed to see whether you have elevated gastrin levels. While elevated gastrin may indicate tumors in your pancreas or duodenum, it can also be caused by other conditions. For example, gastrin may also be elevated if your stomach isn't making acid, or you're taking acid-reducing medications, such as proton pump inhibitors.\n    You need to fast before this test and may need to stop taking any acid-reducing medications to get the most accurate measure of your gastrin levels. Because gastrin levels can fluctuate, this test may be repeated a few times.\n    Your doctor may also perform a secretin stimulation test. For this test, your doctor first measures your gastrin levels, then gives you an injection of the hormone secretin and measures gastrin levels again. If you have Zollinger-Ellison, your gastrin levels will increase even more.\n    \n    Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. After you're sedated, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible instrument with a light and video camera (endoscope) down your throat and into your stomach and duodenum to look for ulcers. Through the endoscope, your doctor may remove a tissue sample (biopsy) from your duodenum to help detect the presence of gastrin-producing tumors. Your doctor will ask you not to eat anything after midnight the night before the test.\n    \n    Endoscopic ultrasound. In this procedure, your doctor examines your stomach, duodenum and pancreas with an endoscope fitted with an ultrasound probe. The probe allows for closer inspection, making it easier to spot tumors.\n    It's also possible to remove a tissue sample through the endoscope. You'll need to fast after midnight the night before this test, and you'll be sedated during the test.\n    \n    Imaging tests. Your doctor may use imaging techniques such as a nuclear scan called somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. This test uses radioactive tracers to help locate tumors. Other helpful imaging tests include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT scanning.\nMore InformationCT scanEndoscopic ultrasoundMRIUltrasoundShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome addresses the hormone-secreting tumors as well as the ulcers they cause.\n        \n            \n            Treatment of tumorsAn operation to remove the tumors that occur in Zollinger-Ellison requires a skilled surgeon because the tumors are often small and difficult to locate. If you have just one tumor, your doctor may be able to remove it surgically, but surgery may not be an option if you have multiple tumors or tumors that have spread to your liver. On the other hand, even if you have multiple tumors, your doctor still may recommend removing a single large tumor.\nIn some cases, doctors advise other treatments to control tumor growth, including:\n\n    Removing as much of a liver tumor as possible (debulking)\n    Attempting to destroy the tumor by cutting off the blood supply (embolization) or by using heat to destroy cancer cells (radiofrequency ablation)\n    Injecting drugs into the tumor to relieve cancer symptoms\n    Using chemotherapy to try to slow tumor growth\n    Having a liver transplant\n\n        \n            \n            Treatment of excess acidExcess acid production can almost always be controlled. Medications known as proton pump inhibitors are the first line of treatment. These are effective medications for decreasing acid production in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\nProton pump inhibitors are powerful drugs that reduce acid by blocking the action of the tiny \"pumps\" within acid-secreting cells. Commonly prescribed medications include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and esomeprazole (Nexium).\nLong-term use of prescription proton pump inhibitors, especially in people age 50 and older, has been associated with an increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist and spine, according to the Food and Drug Administration. This risk is small and should be weighed against the acid-blocking benefits of these medications.\nOctreotide (Sandostatin), a medication similar to the hormone somatostatin, may counteract the effects of gastrin and be helpful for some people.More InformationChemotherapyLiver transplantRadiofrequency ablation for cancer\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

But the sequence of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is clear. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors (gastrinomas) form in your pancreas or duodenum or at other sites such as the lymph nodes adjacent to your pancreas.\nYour pancreas sits behind and below your stomach.

The pancreas also produces several hormones including insulin, a hormone that helps to control your blood glucose.\nDigestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum, the part of the small intestine next to your stomach. This is where digestion reaches its peak.\nThe tumors that occur with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are made up of cells that secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Increased gastrin makes the stomach produce far too much acid.

Although these cases present a diagnostic challenge, the coordination of care to address all of the medical, developmental or behavioral problems will likely be similar.More InformationGenetic testing\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Although there is no cure for DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome), treatments can usually correct critical problems, such as a heart defect or cleft palate. Other health issues and developmental, mental health or behavioral problems can be addressed or monitored as needed.\nTreatments and therapy for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may include interventions for:\n\n    Hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism can usually be managed with calcium supplements and vitamin D supplements.\n    Heart defects. Most heart defects associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome require surgery soon after birth to repair the heart and improve the supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n    Limited thymus gland function. If your child has some thymic function, infections may be frequent, but not necessarily severe. These infections \u2014 usually colds and ear infections \u2014 are generally treated as they would be in any child. Most children with limited thymic function follow the normal schedule of vaccines. For most children with moderate thymus impairment, immune system function improves with age.\n    Severe thymus dysfunction. If the impairment of the thymus is severe or there's no thymus, your child is at risk of a number of severe infections. Treatment requires a transplant of thymus tissue, specialized cells from bone marrow or specialized disease-fighting blood cells.\n    Cleft palate. A cleft palate or other abnormalities of the palate and lip can usually be surgically repaired.\n    Overall development. Your child will likely benefit from a range of therapies, including speech therapy, occupational therapy and developmental therapy. In the United States, early intervention programs providing these types of therapy are usually available through a state or county health department.\n    Mental health care. Treatment may be recommended if your child is later diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, depression, or other mental health or behavioral disorders.\n    Management of other conditions. These may include addressing feeding and growth issues, hearing or vision problems, and other medical conditions.\n\n        \n            \n            Health care teamBecause 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can result in so many problems, several specialists will likely be involved in diagnosing specific conditions, recommending treatments and providing care. This team will evolve as your child's needs change. Specialists on your care team may include these professionals and others, as needed:\n\n    Children's health specialist (pediatrician)\n    Expert in inherited disorders (geneticist)\n    Heart specialist (cardiologist)\n    Immune system specialist (immunologist)\n    Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist\n    Infectious disease specialist\n    Hormone disorder specialist (endocrinologist)\n    Surgeon who specializes in correcting such conditions as a cleft palate (oral and maxillofacial surgeon)\n    Surgeon who specializes in correcting heart defects (cardiovascular surgeon)\n    Occupational therapist to help develop practical, everyday skills\n    Speech therapist to help improve verbal skills and articulation\n    Developmental therapist to help develop age-appropriate behaviors, social skills and interpersonal skills\n    Mental health professional, such as a pediatric psychiatrist or psychologist\nMore InformationBone marrow transplantPsychotherapy\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},
{"Diseases": "Absence seizure", "Symptoms": "An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 20 seconds, without any confusion, headache or drowsiness afterward. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include:\n\n    Sudden stop in motion without falling\n    Lip smacking\n    Eyelid flutters\n    Chewing motions\n    Finger rubbing\n    Small movements of both hands\n\nAfterward, there's no memory of the incident. Some people have many episodes daily, which interfere with school or daily activities.\nA child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices the seizures, because they're so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of this disorder. Teachers may comment about a child's inability to pay attention or that a child is often daydreaming.\nWhen to see a doctor\nContact your doctor:\n\n\n\n    The first time you notice a seizure\n    If this is a new type of seizure\n    If the seizures continue to occur despite taking anti-seizure medication\n\nContact 911 or emergency services in your area:\n\n    If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours \u2014 activities such as eating or moving without awareness \u2014 or prolonged confusion, possible symptoms of a condition called absence status epilepticus\n    After any seizure lasting more than five minutes\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\t\n\t\t@font-face {\n\t\t\tfont-family: mayo-form-icons;\n\t\t\tsrc:

from nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The brain's nerve cells normally send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them.\nIn people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern.\nPeople who have seizures may also have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another (neurotransmitters).\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    EEG brain activity\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tEEG brain activity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEEG brain activity\n\t\t\t\tAn EEG records the electrical activity of your brain via electrodes affixed to your scalp. EEG results show changes in brain activity that may be useful in diagnosing brain conditions, especially epilepsy and other seizure disorders.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nYour doctor will ask for a detailed description of the seizures and conduct a physical exam. Tests may include:\n\n    \n    Electroencephalography (EEG). This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small electrodes attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap.\n    Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the normal pattern.\n    \n    Brain scans. In absence seizures, brain-imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will be normal. But tests such as MRI can produce detailed images of the brain, which can help rule out other problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Because your child will need to hold still for long periods, talk with your doctor about the possible use of sedation.\nMore InformationEEG (electroencephalogram)MRI\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Your doctor likely will start at the lowest dose of anti-seizure medication possible and increase the dosage as needed to control the seizures. Children may be able to taper off anti-seizure medications, under a doctor's supervision, after they've been seizure-free for two years.\nDrugs prescribed for absence seizure include:\n\n    Ethosuximide (Zarontin). This is the drug most doctors start with for absence seizures. In most cases, seizures respond well to this drug. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, trouble sleeping, hyperactivity.\n    \n    Valproic acid (Depakene). Girls who continue to need medication into adulthood should discuss potential risks of valproic acid with their doctors. Valproic acid has been associated with higher risk of birth defects in babies, and doctors advise women against using it during pregnancy or while trying to conceive.\n    Doctors may recommend the use of valproic acid in children who have both absence and grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures.\n    \n    Lamotrigine (Lamictal). Some studies show this drug to be less effective than ethosuximide or valproic acid, but it has fewer side effects. Side effects may include rash and nausea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t@font-face {\n\t\t\tfont-family: mayo-form-icons;\n\t\t\tsrc:

{"Diseases": "Bartholin's cyst", "Symptoms": "If you have a small, noninfected Bartholin's cyst, you may not notice it. If the cyst grows, you might feel a lump or mass near your vaginal opening. Although a cyst is usually painless, it can be tender.\nA full-blown infection of a Bartholin's cyst can occur in a matter of days. If the cyst becomes infected, you may experience:\n\n    A tender, painful lump near the vaginal opening\n    Discomfort while walking or sitting\n    Pain during intercourse\n    Fever\n\nA Bartholin's cyst or abscess typically occurs on only one side of the vaginal opening.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorCall your doctor if you have a painful lump near the opening of your vagina that doesn't improve after two or three days of self-care \u2014 for instance, soaking the area in warm water (sitz bath). If the pain is severe, make an appointment with your doctor right away.\nAlso call your doctor promptly if you find a new lump near your vaginal opening and you're older than 40. Although rare, such a lump may be a sign of a more serious problem, such as cancer.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Experts believe that the cause of a Bartholin's cyst is a backup of fluid. Fluid may accumulate when the opening of the gland (duct) becomes obstructed, perhaps caused by infection or injury.\nA Bartholin's cyst can become infected, forming an abscess. A number of bacteria may cause the infection, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bacteria that cause sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To diagnose a Bartholin's cyst, your doctor may:\n\n    Ask questions about your medical history\n    Perform a pelvic exam\n    Take a sample of secretions from your vagina or cervix to test for a sexually transmitted infection\n    Recommend a test of the mass (biopsy) to check for cancerous cells if you're postmenopausal or over 40\n\nIf cancer is a concern, your doctor may refer you to a gynecologist who specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system.More InformationNeedle biopsyPelvic exam\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Often a Bartholin's cyst requires no treatment \u2014 especially if the cyst causes no signs or symptoms. When needed, treatment depends on the size of the cyst, your discomfort level and whether it's infected, which can result in an abscess.\nTreatment options your doctor may recommend include:\n\n    Sitz baths. Soaking in a tub filled with a few inches of warm water (sitz bath) several times a day for three or four days may help a small, infected cyst to rupture and drain on its own.\n    \n    Surgical drainage. You may need surgery to drain a cyst that's infected or very large. Drainage of a cyst can be done using local anesthesia or sedation.\n    For the procedure, your doctor makes a small incision in the cyst, allows it to drain, and then places a small rubber tube (catheter) in the incision. The catheter stays in place for up to six weeks to keep the incision open and allow complete drainage.\n    \n    Antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if your cyst is infected or if testing reveals that you have a sexually transmitted infection. But if the abscess is drained properly, you may not need antibiotics.\n    Marsupialization. If cysts recur or bother you, a marsupialization (mahr-soo-pee-ul-ih-ZAY-shun) procedure may help. Your doctor places stitches on each side of a drainage incision to create a permanent opening less than 1/4-inch (about 6-millimeter) long. An inserted catheter may be placed to promote drainage for a few days after the procedure and to help prevent recurrence.\n\nRarely, for persistent cysts that aren't effectively treated by the above procedures, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the Bartholin's gland. Surgical removal is usually done in a hospital under general anesthesia. Surgical removal of the gland carries a greater risk of bleeding or complications after the procedure.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},
{"Diseases": "Hyperhidrosis", "Symptoms": "Most people sweat when they exercise or exert themselves, are in a hot environment, or are anxious or under stress. The excessive sweating experienced with hyperhidrosis far exceeds such normal sweating.\nThe type of hyperhidrosis that usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face causes at least one episode a week, during waking hours. And the sweating usually occurs on both sides of the body.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSometimes excessive sweating is a sign of a serious condition.\nSeek immediate medical attention if your heavy sweating is accompanied by lightheadedness, chest pain or nausea.\nSee your doctor if:\n\n    Sweating disrupts your daily routine\n    Sweating causes emotional distress or social withdrawal\n    You suddenly begin to sweat more than usual\n    You experience night sweats for no apparent reason\n\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Sweat glands\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSweat glands\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tSweat glands\r\n\t\t\t\tYour skin has two types of sweat glands: eccrine and apocrine. Eccrine glands occur over most of your body and open directly onto the surface of your skin. Apocrine glands open into the hair follicle, leading to the surface of the skin. Apocrine glands develop in areas abundant in hair follicles, such as on your scalp, armpits and groin.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweating is your body's mechanism to cool itself. Your nervous system automatically triggers your sweat glands when your body temperature rises. Sweating also normally occurs, especially on your palms, when you're nervous.\nThe most common form of hyperhidrosis is called primary focal (essential) hyperhidrosis. With this type, the nerves responsible for signaling your sweat glands become overactive, even though they haven't been triggered by physical activity or a rise in temperature. With stress or nervousness, the problem becomes even worse. This type usually affects your palms and soles and sometimes your face.\nThere is no medical cause for this type of hyperhidrosis. It may have a hereditary component, because it sometimes runs in families.\nSecondary hyperhidrosis occurs when excess sweating is due to a medical condition. It's the less common type. It's more likely to cause sweating all over your body. Conditions that may lead to heavy sweating include:\n\n    Diabetes\n    Menopause hot flashes\n    Thyroid problems\n    Low blood sugar\n    Some types of cancer\n    Heart attack\n    Nervous system disorders\n    Infections\n\nCertain medications also can lead to heavy sweating, as can opioid withdrawal.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During your appointment, your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms.

If no clear cause can be found, treatment focuses on controlling excessive sweating. Sometimes you may need to try a combination of treatments. And even if your sweating improves after treatment, it may recur.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsDrugs used to treat hyperhidrosis include:\n\n    Prescription antiperspirant. Your doctor may prescribe an antiperspirant with aluminum chloride (Drysol, Xerac Ac). This product can cause skin and eye irritation. It's usually applied to the affected skin before you go to bed. Then you wash the product off when you get up, taking care to not get any in your eyes. If your skin becomes irritated, hydrocortisone cream might help.\n    Prescription creams. A prescription cream that contains glycopyrrolate may help hyperhidrosis that affects the face and head.\n    Nerve-blocking medications. Some oral medications block the chemicals that permit certain nerves to communicate with each other. This can reduce sweating in some people. Possible side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision and bladder problems.\n    Antidepressants. Some medications used for depression can also decrease sweating. In addition, they may help decrease the anxiety that worsens the hyperhidrosis.\n    Botulinum toxin injections. Treatment with botulinum toxin (Botox, Myobloc, others) temporarily blocks the nerves that cause sweating. Your skin will be iced or anesthetized first. Each affected area of your body will need several injections. The effects last six to 12 months, and then the treatment needs to be repeated. This treatment can be painful, and some people experience temporary muscle weakness in the treated area.\n\n        \n            \n            Surgical and other proceduresOther hyperhidrosis treatments include:\n\n    Microwave therapy. With this therapy, a device that delivers microwave energy is used to destroy sweat glands. Treatments involve two 20- to 30-minute sessions, three months apart. Possible side effects are a change in skin sensation and some discomfort. This therapy may be expensive and not widely available.\n    Sweat gland removal. If excessive sweating occurs just in your armpits, removing the sweat glands there may help. A minimally invasive technique called suction curettage may be an option, too, if you aren't responding to other treatments.\n    Nerve surgery (sympathectomy).

In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from multiple locations in the upper chambers \u2014 most often from the pulmonary veins. The atrioventricular (AV) node doesn't stop the extra signals from entering the ventricles. The result is a rapid and chaotic heartbeat.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAtrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that occurs when the two upper chambers of your heart experience chaotic electrical signals. The result is a fast and irregular heart rhythm. The heart rate in atrial fibrillation may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute. The normal range for a heart rate is 60 to 100 beats a minute.\nYour heart is made up of four chambers \u2014 two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Within the upper right chamber of your heart (right atrium) is a group of cells called the sinus node. This is your heart's natural pacemaker. The sinus node produces the signal that normally starts each heartbeat.\nNormally, the signal travels through the two upper heart chambers, and then through a connecting pathway between the upper and lower chambers called the atrioventricular (AV) node. The movement of the signal causes your heart to squeeze (contract), sending blood to your heart and body.\nIn atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of your heart are chaotic. As a result, they quiver. The AV node \u2014 the electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles \u2014 is bombarded with impulses trying to get through to the ventricles.\nThe ventricles also beat rapidly, but not as rapidly as the atria, as not all the impulses get through.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Possible causes of atrial fibrillationAbnormalities or damage to the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation.

Sometimes you may have atrial flutter that develops into atrial fibrillation and vice versa.\nThe risk factors for and the symptoms and causes of atrial flutter are similar to those of atrial fibrillation. For example, strokes are also a concern in someone with atrial flutter.

Generally, the treatment goals for atrial fibrillation are to:\n\n    Reset the rhythm or control the rate\n    Prevent blood clots, which may decrease the risk of a stroke\n\nThe strategy you and your doctor choose depends on many factors, including whether you have other problems with your heart and if you're able to take medications that can control your heart rhythm. In some cases, you may need a more invasive treatment, such as medical procedures using catheters or surgery.\nIn some people, a specific event or an underlying condition, such as a thyroid disorder, may trigger atrial fibrillation. Treating the condition causing atrial fibrillation may help relieve your heart rhythm problems.

To correct your condition, doctors may be able to reset your heart to its regular rhythm (sinus rhythm) using a procedure called cardioversion, depending on the underlying cause of atrial fibrillation and how long you've had it.\nCardioversion can be done in two ways:\n\n    \n    Electrical cardioversion. In this brief procedure, an electrical shock is delivered to your heart through paddles or patches placed on your chest. The shock stops your heart's electrical activity for a short moment. The goal is to reset your heart's normal rhythm.\n    You will be given a sedative before the procedure, so you shouldn't feel the electric shock. You may also receive medications to help restore a normal heartbeat (anti-arrhythmics) before the procedure.\n    \n    \n    Cardioversion with drugs. This form of cardioversion uses medications called anti-arrhythmics to help restore normal sinus rhythm. Depending on your heart condition, you may receive medications through an IV or by mouth to help return your heart to normal rhythm.\n    This is often done in the hospital with continuous monitoring of your heart rate. If your heart rhythm returns to normal, your doctor often will prescribe the same anti-arrhythmic medication or a similar one to try to prevent more spells of atrial fibrillation.\n    \n\nBefore cardioversion, you may be given warfarin or another blood-thinning medication for several weeks to reduce the risk of blood clots and strokes. If your episode of atrial fibrillation lasted more than 48 hours, you may need to take this type of medication for at least a month after the procedure to prevent blood clots in the heart.\n        \n            \n            Maintaining a normal heart rhythmAfter electrical cardioversion, your doctor may prescribe anti-arrhythmic medications to help prevent future episodes of atrial fibrillation. Medications may include:\n\n    Dofetilide\n    Flecainide\n    Propafenone\n    Amiodarone\n    Sotalol\n\nAlthough these drugs may help maintain a normal heart rhythm, they can cause side effects, including:\n\n    Nausea\n    Dizziness\n    Fatigue\n\nRarely, they may cause ventricular arrhythmias \u2014 life-threatening rhythm disturbances originating in the heart's lower chambers. These medications may be needed indefinitely. Even with medications, there is a chance of another episode of atrial fibrillation.\n        \n            \n            Heart rate controlYou may be prescribed medications to control how fast your heart beats and restore it to a normal rate.\n\n    Digoxin. This medication may control the heart rate at rest, but not as well during activity. Most people need additional or alternative medications, such as calcium channel blockers or beta blockers.\n    Beta blockers. These medications can help to slow the heart rate at rest and during activity. They may cause side effects such as low blood pressure (hypotension).\n    Calcium channel blockers. These medicines also can control your heart rate, but may need to be avoided if you have heart failure or low blood pressure.\n\n        \n            \n            Catheter and surgical procedures\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Catheter ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins to treat atrial fibrillation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCatheter ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins to treat atrial fibrillation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCatheter ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins to treat atrial fibrillation\n\t\t\t\tAtrial fibrillation is often caused by rapidly discharging triggers, or \"hot spots.\" In catheter ablation to treat atrial fibrillation, a doctor inserts long, thin tubes (catheters) into your groin and guides them through blood vessels to your heart. The electrodes at the tips of the catheters help your doctor determine where these triggers are located. Electrodes at the catheter tips can use radiofrequency energy, extreme cold (cryotherapy) or heat to destroy these triggers, scarring the tissue so that the erratic signals are normalized.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    AV node ablation\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAV node ablation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAV node ablation\n\t\t\t\tIn atrioventricular (AV) node ablation, doctors use heat (radiofrequency) energy to destroy the electrical connection between the upper and lower heart chambers (AV node), blocking the heart's electrical signals. Once the AV node is destroyed, doctors then implant a small medical device to maintain your heart rhythm (pacemaker).\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nSometimes medications or cardioversion to control atrial fibrillation doesn't work. In those cases, your doctor may recommend a procedure to destroy the area of heart tissue that's causing the erratic electrical signals and restore your heart to a normal rhythm. These options can include:\n\n    \n    Catheter ablation. During this procedure, a doctor inserts long, thin tubes (catheters) into your groin and guides them through blood vessels to your heart. The catheter's tip produces radiofrequency energy, extreme cold (cryotherapy) or heat to destroy areas of heart tissue that are causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Scar tissue forms, which helps signaling return to normal. Cardiac ablation may correct the arrhythmia without the need for medications or implantable devices.\n    Your doctor may recommend this procedure if you have atrial fibrillation and an otherwise normal heart and medication has not improved your symptoms. It may also be helpful for heart failure patients who have an implanted device and cannot take or tolerate anti-arrhythmic medications.\n    \n    \n    Maze procedure. There are several variations of the maze procedure. The doctor may use a scalpel, radiofrequency or extreme cold (cryotherapy) to create a pattern of scar tissue that interferes with stray electrical impulses that cause atrial fibrillation.\n    The maze procedures have a high success rate, but atrial fibrillation may come back. If this happens, you may need another cardiac ablation or other heart treatment.\n    Because the surgical maze procedure (using a scalpel) requires open-heart surgery, it's generally reserved for people who don't get better with other treatments or when it can be done during a necessary heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or heart valve repair.\n    \n    Atrioventricular (AV) node ablation. If medications or other forms of catheter ablation don't work or cause side effects, or if you're not a good candidate for these therapies, AV node ablation may be an option. The procedure involves using a catheter to deliver radiofrequency energy to the pathway (AV node) connecting the upper and lower heart chambers.\n    The procedure destroys a small area of heart tissue, preventing abnormal signaling. However, the upper chambers of the heart (atria) will still quiver. You'll need a pacemaker to be implanted to keep the lower chambers (ventricles) beating properly. You'll need to take blood thinners after this procedure to reduce the risk of a stroke due to atrial fibrillation.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Preventing blood clotsMany people with atrial fibrillation or those who are undergoing certain treatments for atrial fibrillation are at especially high risk of blood clots that can lead to a stroke. The risk is even higher if other heart disease is present along with atrial fibrillation.\nAnticoagulants\nYour doctor may prescribe blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) such as:\n\n    Warfarin. Warfarin may be prescribed to prevent blood clots. If you're prescribed warfarin, carefully follow your doctor's instructions. Warfarin is a powerful medication that may cause dangerous bleeding. You'll need to have regular blood tests to monitor warfarin's effects.\n    Newer anticoagulants. Several newer blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) are available to prevent strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. These medications include dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. They are shorter acting than warfarin and usually don't require regular blood tests or monitoring by your doctor. These medications aren't approved for people who have mechanical heart valves.\n\nMany people have spells of atrial fibrillation and don't even know it \u2014 so you may need lifelong anticoagulants even after your rhythm has been restored to normal.\nLeft atrial appendage closure\nYour doctor may also consider a procedure called left atrial appendage closure.\nIn this procedure, doctors insert a catheter through a vein in the leg and eventually guide it to the upper left heart chamber (left atrium). A device called a left atrial appendage closure device is then inserted through the catheter to close a small sac (appendage) in the left atrium.\nThis may reduce the risk of blood clots in certain people with atrial fibrillation, as many blood clots that occur in atrial fibrillation form in the left atrial appendage. Candidates for this procedure may include those who don't have heart valve problems, who have an increased risk of blood clots and bleeding, and who are aren't able to take anticoagulants. Your doctor will evaluate you and determine if you're a candidate for the procedure.More InformationAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAtrial fibrillation ablationAV node ablationCardiac ablationMaze procedureMinimally invasive heart surgeryPulmonary vein isolationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillationShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives.\nIn older adults, a sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying disease requiring medical attention.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers and other skin products can cause a serious reaction.

Bacteria can trigger inflammation and infection resulting in more severe acne.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFour main factors cause acne:\n\n    Excess oil (sebum) production\n    Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells\n    Bacteria\n    Inflammation\n\nAcne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.\nThe follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air.\nPimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne.\nCertain things may trigger or worsen acne:\n\n    Hormonal changes. Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too.\n    Certain medications. Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium.\n    Diet. Studies indicate that consuming certain foods \u2014 including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips \u2014 may worsen acne. Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions.\n    Stress. Stress doesn't cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Acne mythsThese factors have little effect on acne:\n\n    Chocolate and greasy foods. Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne.\n    Hygiene. Acne isn't caused by dirty skin. In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse.\n    Cosmetics. Cosmetics don't necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. Nonoily cosmetics don't interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs.\nMore InformationAdult acne: Can natural hormone treatments help?\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "", "Treatment": "If you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for several weeks and they haven't helped, ask your doctor about prescription-strength medications. A dermatologist can help you:\n\n    Control your acne\n    Avoid scarring or other damage to your skin\n    Make scars less noticeable\n\nAcne medications work by reducing oil production and swelling or by treating bacterial infection. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely.\nThe treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are often used in combination. Treatment options for pregnant women are limited due to the risk of side effects.\nTalk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering. And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves.\n        \n            \n            Topical medicationsThe most common topical prescription medications for acne are:\n\n    \n    Retinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.\n    Topical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with skin of color. Adapalene may be tolerated best.\n    \n    Antibiotics. These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance. Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, others) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin). Topical antibiotics alone aren't recommended.\n    \n    Azelaic acid and salicylic acid. Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast. It has antibacterial properties. A 20% azelaic acid cream or gel seems to be as effective as many conventional acne treatments when used twice a day. Prescription azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) is an option during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne. Side effects include skin redness and minor skin irritation.\n    Salicylic acid may help prevent plugged hair follicles and is available as both wash-off and leave-on products. Studies showing its effectiveness are limited. Side effects include skin discoloration and minor skin irritation.\n    \n    Dapsone. Dapsone (Aczone) 5% gel twice daily is recommended for inflammatory acne, especially in women with acne. Side effects include redness and dryness.\n\nEvidence is not strong in support of using zinc, sulfur, nicotinamide, resorcinol, sulfacetamide sodium or aluminum chloride in topical treatments for acne.\n        \n            \n            Oral medications\n    \n    Antibiotics. For moderate to severe acne, you may need oral antibiotics to reduce bacteria. Usually the first choice for treating acne is a tetracycline (minocycline, doxycycline) or a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin). A macrolide might be an option for people who can't take tetracyclines, including pregnant women and children under 8 years old.\n    Oral antibiotics should be used for the shortest time possible to prevent antibiotic resistance. And they should be combined with other drugs, such as benzoyl peroxide, to reduce the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.\n    Severe side effects from the use of antibiotics to treat acne are uncommon. These drugs do increase your skin's sun sensitivity.\n    \n    \n    Combined oral contraceptives. Four combined oral contraceptives are approved by the FDA for acne therapy in women who also wish to use them for contraception. They are products that combine progestin and estrogen (Ortho Tri-Cyclen 21, Yaz, others). You may not see the benefit of this treatment for a few months, so using other acne medications with it for the first few weeks may help.\n    Common side effects of combined oral contraceptives are weight gain, breast tenderness and nausea. These drugs are also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular problems, breast cancer and cervical cancer.\n    \n    Anti-androgen agents. The drug spironolactone (Aldactone) may be considered for women and adolescent girls if oral antibiotics aren't helping. It works by blocking the effect of androgen hormones on the oil-producing glands. Possible side effects include breast tenderness and painful periods.\n    \n    Isotretinoin. Isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, others) is a derivative of vitamin A. It may be prescribed for people whose moderate or severe acne hasn't responded to other treatments.\n    Potential side effects of oral isotretinoin include inflammatory bowel disease, depression and severe birth defects. All people receiving isotretinoin must participate in an FDA-approved risk management program. And they'll need to see their doctors regularly to monitor for side effects.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            TherapiesFor some people, the following therapies might be helpful, either alone or in combination with medications.\n\n    Light therapy. A variety of light-based therapies have been tried with some success. Most will require multiple visits to your doctor's office. Further study is needed to determine the ideal method, light source and dose.\n    Chemical peel. This procedure uses repeated applications of a chemical solution, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid or retinoic acid. This treatment is for mild acne. It might improve the appearance of the skin, though the change is not long lasting and repeat treatments are usually needed.\n    Drainage and extraction. Your doctor may use special tools to gently remove whiteheads and blackheads (comedos) or cysts that haven't cleared up with topical medications. This technique temporarily improves the appearance of your skin, but it might also cause scarring.\n    Steroid injection. Nodular and cystic lesions can be treated by injecting a steroid drug into them. This therapy has resulted in rapid improvement and decreased pain. Side effects may include skin thinning and discoloration in the treated area.\n\n        \n            \n            Treating childrenMost studies of acne drugs have involved people 12 years of age or older. Increasingly, younger children are getting acne as well. The FDA has expanded the number of topical products approved for use in children. And guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology indicate that topical benzoyl peroxide, adapalene and tretinoin in preadolescent children are effective and don't cause increased risk of side effects.\nIf your child has acne, consider consulting a pediatric dermatologist. Ask about drugs to avoid in children, appropriate doses, drug interactions, side effects, and how treatment may affect a child's growth and development.More InformationAcne treatments: Medical procedures may help clear skinAcne scars: What's the best treatment?Birth control pills for acne?Chemical peelDermabrasionLaser resurfacingLight therapyTake action against acneShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

One out of 400 babies is born with a chest wall that doesn't form properly and becomes concave. Kids with pectus routinely have surgery. Adults have either had to live with it or face major more complicated operations. Now, doctors at Mayo Clinic are performing the same surgery for kids on adults and improving the lives of many people.\nWe're doing a repair of a deformity of the chest wall, called a pectus excavatum.\nDr. Dawn Jaroszewski is a thoracic surgeon, who specializes in pectus repair.\nIt was once thought that these deformities were all cosmetic and it didn't affect the patient at all. And now, we're finding out that people can have very severe heart and lung problems.\nA couple of years ago, I developed a little bit of a wheezey cough.\nMichelle Kroeger had a mild case of pectus that got worse over time.\nWhen I'd be running, it'd be harder and harder. I'd get more short of breath. And then I was getting more palpitations in my heart, chest pain.\nYou can see here this very narrow space between her spine here and her chest.\nThe concave chest was compressing Michelle's lung, and it shifted her heart to the left. Traditional surgery for adults means major surgery, opening the chest, and remodeling the chest wall. But Dr. Jaroszewski uses a much less invasive technique that was once only used for children.\nFirst, Dr. Jaroszewski makes small incisions on either side of the patient. Then, guided by a small camera, she inserts bars that lift the chest wall into a more normal position.\nThis is an x-ray, which shows an adult two bars and a nice repair.\nThe bars are sort of like braces. Michelle will keep them for about two years. When they come out her chest will retain its new shape. Now, she can continue her busy life symptom free.\nMichelle says she got relief from symptoms almost immediately after surgery. The only drawback to having the bars in her chest, Michelle says, she sets off the metal detectors in airports, which to her is a small price to pay for a better quality of life.

If left untreated, here's how plaque can eventually advance to periodontitis:\n\n    Plaque forms on your teeth when starches and sugars in food interact with bacteria normally found in your mouth. Brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day removes plaque, but plaque re-forms quickly.\n    Plaque can harden under your gumline into tartar (calculus) if it stays on your teeth. Tartar is more difficult to remove and it's filled with bacteria. The longer plaque and tartar remain on your teeth, the more damage they can do. You can't get rid of tartar by brushing and flossing \u2014 you need a professional dental cleaning to remove it.\n    Plaque can cause gingivitis, the mildest form of gum disease. Gingivitis is irritation and inflammation of the part of your gum tissue around the base of your teeth (gingiva). Gingivitis can be reversed with professional treatment and good home oral care.\n    Ongoing gum inflammation can cause periodontitis, eventually causing pockets to develop between your gums and teeth that fill with plaque, tartar and bacteria. In time, these pockets become deeper, filling with more bacteria. If not treated, these deep infections cause a loss of tissue and bone, and ultimately you may lose one or more teeth. Also, ongoing chronic inflammation can put a strain on your immune system.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To determine whether you have periodontitis and how severe it is, your dentist may:\n\n    Review your medical history to identify any factors that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as smoking or taking certain medications that cause dry mouth.\n    Examine your mouth to look for plaque and tartar buildup and check for easy bleeding.\n    Measure the pocket depth of the groove between your gums and teeth by placing a dental probe beside your tooth beneath your gumline, usually at several sites throughout your mouth. In a healthy mouth, the pocket depth is usually between 1 and 3 millimeters (mm). Pockets deeper than 4 mm may indicate periodontitis. Pockets deeper than 5 mm cannot be cleaned well.\n    Take dental X-rays to check for bone loss in areas where your dentist observes deeper pocket depths.\n\nYour dentist may assign a stage and a grade to periodontitis based on the severity of the disease, the complexity of treatment, your risk factors and your health.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment may be performed by a periodontist, a dentist or a dental hygienist. The goal of periodontitis treatment is to thoroughly clean the pockets around teeth and prevent damage to surrounding bone. You have the best chance for successful treatment when you also adopt a daily routine of good oral care, manage health conditions that may impact dental health and stop tobacco use.\n        \n            \n            Nonsurgical treatmentsIf periodontitis isn't advanced, treatment may involve less invasive procedures, including:\n\n    Scaling. Scaling removes tartar and bacteria from your tooth surfaces and beneath your gums. It may be performed using instruments, a laser or an ultrasonic device.\n    Root planing. Root planing smooths the root surfaces, discouraging further buildup of tartar and bacteria, and removes bacterial byproducts that contribute to inflammation and delay healing or reattachment of the gum to the tooth surfaces.\n    Antibiotics. Topical or oral antibiotics can help control bacterial infection. Topical antibiotics can include antibiotic mouth rinses or insertion of gels containing antibiotics in the space between your teeth and gums or into pockets after deep cleaning. However, oral antibiotics may be necessary to completely eliminate infection-causing bacteria.\n\n        \n            \n            Surgical treatmentsIf you have advanced periodontitis, treatment may require dental surgery, such as:\n\n    Flap surgery (pocket reduction surgery). Your periodontist makes tiny incisions in your gum so that a section of gum tissue can be lifted back, exposing the roots for more effective scaling and root planing. Because periodontitis often causes bone loss, the underlying bone may be recontoured before the gum tissue is sutured back in place. After you heal, it's easier to clean these areas and maintain healthy gum tissue.\n    Soft tissue grafts. When you lose gum tissue, your gumline recedes. You may need to have some of the damaged soft tissue reinforced. This is usually done by removing a small amount of tissue from the roof of your mouth (palate) or using tissue from another donor source and attaching it to the affected site. This can help reduce further gum recession, cover exposed roots and give your teeth a more pleasing appearance.\n    Bone grafting. This procedure is performed when periodontitis has destroyed the bone surrounding your tooth root. The graft may be composed of small fragments of your own bone, or the bone may be synthetic or donated. The bone graft helps prevent tooth loss by holding your tooth in place. It also serves as a platform for the regrowth of natural bone.\n    Guided tissue regeneration. This allows the regrowth of bone that was destroyed by bacteria. In one approach, your dentist places a special piece of biocompatible fabric between existing bone and your tooth. The material prevents unwanted tissue from entering the healing area, allowing bone to grow back instead.\n    Tissue-stimulating proteins. Another technique involves applying a special gel to a diseased tooth root. This gel contains the same proteins found in developing tooth enamel and stimulates the growth of healthy bone and tissue.\n\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Hypothyroidism may be due to a number of factors, including:\n\n    \n    Autoimmune disease. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disorder known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Autoimmune disorders occur when your immune system produces antibodies that attack your own tissues. Sometimes this process involves your thyroid gland.\n    Scientists aren't sure why this happens, but it's likely a combination of factors, such as your genes and an environmental trigger. However it happens, these antibodies affect the thyroid's ability to produce hormones.\n    \n    Over-response to hyperthyroidism treatment. People who produce too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) are often treated with radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications. The goal of these treatments is to get thyroid function back to normal. But sometimes, correcting hyperthyroidism can end up lowering thyroid hormone production too much, resulting in permanent hypothyroidism.\n    Thyroid surgery. Removing all or a large portion of your thyroid gland can diminish or halt hormone production. In that case, you'll need to take thyroid hormone for life.\n    Radiation therapy. Radiation used to treat cancers of the head and neck can affect your thyroid gland and may lead to hypothyroidism.\n    Medications. A number of medications can contribute to hypothyroidism. One such medication is lithium, which is used to treat certain psychiatric disorders. If you're taking medication, ask your doctor about its effect on your thyroid gland.\n\nLess often, hypothyroidism may result from one of the following:\n\n    Congenital disease. Some babies are born with a defective thyroid gland or no thyroid gland. In most cases, the thyroid gland didn't develop normally for unknown reasons, but some children have an inherited form of the disorder. Often, infants with congenital hypothyroidism appear normal at birth. That's one reason why most states now require newborn thyroid screening.\n    Pituitary disorder. A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to produce enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) \u2014 usually because of a benign tumor of the pituitary gland.\n    Pregnancy. Some women develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy (postpartum hypothyroidism), often because they produce antibodies to their own thyroid gland. Left untreated, hypothyroidism increases the risk of miscarriage, premature delivery and preeclampsia \u2014 a condition that causes a significant rise in a woman's blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy. It can also seriously affect the developing fetus.\n    Iodine deficiency. The trace mineral iodine \u2014 found primarily in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt \u2014 is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism, and too much iodine can worsen hypothyroidism in people who already have the condition. In some parts of the world, iodine deficiency is common, but the addition of iodine to table salt has virtually eliminated this problem in the United States.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "In general, your doctor may test for an underactive thyroid if you are feeling increasingly tired, have dry skin, constipation and weight gain, or have had previous thyroid problems or a goiter.\n        \n            \n            Blood testsDiagnosis of hypothyroidism is based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests that measure the level of TSH and sometimes the level of the thyroid hormone thyroxine. A low level of thyroxine and high level of TSH indicate an underactive thyroid. That's because your pituitary produces more TSH in an effort to stimulate your thyroid gland into producing more thyroid hormone.\nDoctors can diagnose thyroid disorders much earlier than in the past \u2014 often before you experience symptoms. Because the TSH test is the best screening test, your doctor will likely check TSH first and follow with a thyroid hormone test if needed.\nTSH tests also play an important role in managing hypothyroidism. They help your doctor determine the right dosage of medication, both initially and over time.\nIn addition, TSH tests are used to help diagnose a condition called subclinical hypothyroidism, which usually causes no outward signs or symptoms. In this condition, you have normal blood levels of triiodothyronine and thyroxine, but higher than normal levels of TSH.\nThere are certain factors that can affect blood tests for thyroid problems. One is the blood-thinning medication called heparin. Another is biotin, a vitamin taken as a stand-alone supplement or as part of a multivitamin. Let your doctor know about any medications or supplements you take before having blood tests done.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Standard treatment for hypothyroidism involves daily use of the synthetic thyroid hormone levothyroxine (Levo-T, Synthroid, others). This oral medication restores adequate hormone levels, reversing the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.\nYou'll likely start to feel better soon after you start treatment. The medication gradually lowers cholesterol levels elevated by the disease and may reverse any weight gain. Treatment with levothyroxine will likely be lifelong, but because the dosage you need may change, your doctor is likely to check your TSH level every year.\n        \n            \n            Determining proper dosage may take timeTo determine the right dosage of levothyroxine initially, your doctor generally checks your level of TSH after six to eight weeks. After that, blood levels are generally checked six months later. Excessive amounts of the hormone can cause side effects, such as:\n\n    Increased appetite\n    Insomnia\n    Heart palpitations\n    Shakiness\n\nIf you have coronary artery disease or severe hypothyroidism, your doctor may start treatment with a smaller amount of medication and gradually increase the dosage. Progressive hormone replacement allows your heart to adjust to the increase in metabolism.\nLevothyroxine causes virtually no side effects when used in the appropriate dose and is relatively inexpensive. If you change brands, let your doctor know to ensure you're still receiving the right dosage.\nAlso, don't skip doses or stop taking the drug because you're feeling better. If you do, the symptoms of hypothyroidism will gradually return.\n        \n            \n            Proper absorption of levothyroxineCertain medications, supplements and even some foods may affect your ability to absorb levothyroxine. Talk to your doctor if you eat large amounts of soy products or a high-fiber diet or you take other medications, such as:\n\n    Iron supplements or multivitamins that contain iron\n    Aluminum hydroxide, which is found in some antacids\n    Calcium supplements\n\nLevothyroxine is best taken on an empty stomach at the same time every day. Ideally, you'll take the hormone in the morning and wait an hour before eating or taking other medications. If you take it at bedtime, wait four hours after your last meal or snack.\nIf you miss a dose of levothyroxine, take two pills the next day.\n        \n            \n            Subclinical hypothyroidismIf you have subclinical hypothyroidism, discuss treatment with your doctor. For a relatively mild increase in TSH, you probably won't benefit from thyroid hormone therapy, and treatment could even be harmful. On the other hand, for a higher TSH level, thyroid hormones may improve your cholesterol level, the pumping ability of your heart and your energy level.More InformationHypothyroidism dietHypothyroidism: Can calcium supplements interfere with treatment?Hypothyroidism: Should I take iodine supplements?Soy: Does it worsen hypothyroidism?Show more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Most doctors consider blood pressure too low only if it causes symptoms.\nSome experts define low blood pressure as readings lower than 90 mm Hg systolic or 60 mm Hg diastolic. If either number is below that, your pressure is lower than normal.\nA sudden fall in blood pressure can be dangerous. A change of just 20 mm Hg \u2014 a drop from 110 systolic to 90 mm Hg systolic, for example \u2014 can cause dizziness and fainting when the brain fails to receive enough blood. And big drops, such as those caused by uncontrolled bleeding, severe infections or allergic reactions, can be life-threatening.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Conditions that can cause low blood pressureMedical conditions that can cause low blood pressure include:\n\n    Pregnancy. Because the circulatory system expands rapidly during pregnancy, blood pressure is likely to drop. This is normal, and blood pressure usually returns to your pre-pregnancy level after you've given birth.\n    Heart problems. Some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack and heart failure.\n    Endocrine problems. Parathyroid disease, adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and, in some cases, diabetes can trigger low blood pressure.\n    Dehydration. When your body loses more water than it takes in, it can cause weakness, dizziness and fatigue. Fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea, overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise can lead to dehydration.\n    Blood loss. Losing a lot of blood, such as from a major injury or internal bleeding, reduces the amount of blood in your body, leading to a severe drop in blood pressure.\n    Severe infection (septicemia). When an infection in the body enters the bloodstream, it can lead to a life-threatening drop in blood pressure called septic shock.\n    Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Common triggers of this severe and potentially life-threatening reaction include foods, certain medications, insect venoms and latex. Anaphylaxis can cause breathing problems, hives, itching, a swollen throat and a dangerous drop in blood pressure.\n    Lack of nutrients in your diet. A lack of the vitamin B-12, folate and iron can keep your body from producing enough red blood cells (anemia), causing low blood pressure.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Medications that can cause low blood pressureSome medications can cause low blood pressure, including:\n\n    Water pills (diuretics), such as furosemide (Lasix) and hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide, others)\n    Alpha blockers, such as prazosin (Minipress)\n    Beta blockers, such as atenolol (Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL, others)\n    Drugs for Parkinson's disease, such as pramipexole (Mirapex) or those containing levodopa\n    Certain types of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants), including doxepin (Silenor) and imipramine (Tofranil)\n    Drugs for erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) or tadalafil (Adcirca, Alyq, Cialis), particularly when taken with the heart medication nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, others)\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Types of low blood pressureDoctors often break down low blood pressure (hypotension) into categories, depending on the causes and other factors. Some types of low blood pressure include:\n\n    \n    Low blood pressure on standing up (orthostatic or postural) hypotension). This is a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up from a sitting position or after lying down.\n    Gravity causes blood to pool in your legs when you stand. Ordinarily, your body compensates by increasing your heart rate and constricting blood vessels, thereby ensuring that enough blood returns to your brain.\n    But in people with orthostatic hypotension, this compensating mechanism fails and blood pressure falls, leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision and even fainting.\n    Orthostatic hypotension can occur for various reasons, including dehydration, prolonged bed rest, pregnancy, diabetes, heart problems, burns, excessive heat, large varicose veins and certain neurological disorders.\n    A number of medications also can cause orthostatic hypotension, particularly drugs used to treat high blood pressure \u2014 diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \u2014 as well as antidepressants and drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease and erectile dysfunction.\n    Orthostatic hypotension is especially common in older adults, but it also affects young, otherwise healthy people who stand up suddenly after sitting with their legs crossed for long periods or after squatting for a time.\n    \n    \n    Low blood pressure after eating (postprandial hypotension). This drop in blood pressure occurs one to two hours after eating and affects mostly older adults.\n    Blood flows to your digestive tract after you eat. Ordinarily, your body increases your heart rate and constricts certain blood vessels to help maintain normal blood pressure. But in some people these mechanisms fail, leading to dizziness, faintness and falls.\n    Postprandial hypotension is more likely to affect people with high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system disorders such as Parkinson's disease.\n    Eating small, low-carbohydrate meals; drinking more water; and avoiding alcohol might help reduce symptoms.\n    \n    Low blood pressure from faulty brain signals (neurally mediated hypotension). This disorder, which causes a blood pressure drop after standing for long periods, mostly affects young adults and children. It seems to occur because of a miscommunication between the heart and the brain.\n    Low blood pressure due to nervous system damage (multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension). Also called Shy-Drager syndrome, this rare disorder has many Parkinson disease-like symptoms. It causes progressive damage to the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and digestion. It's associated with having very high blood pressure while lying down.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Tilt table test\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTilt table test\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTilt table test\n\t\t\t\tYou begin by lying flat on a table.

For instance, when medication causes low blood pressure, treatment usually involves changing or stopping the medication or lowering the dose.\nIf it's not clear what's causing low blood pressure or no treatment exists, the goal is to raise your blood pressure and reduce signs and symptoms. Depending on your age, health and the type of low blood pressure you have, you can do this in several ways:\n\n    \n    Use more salt. Experts usually recommend limiting salt in your diet because sodium can raise blood pressure, sometimes dramatically. For people with low blood pressure, that can be a good thing.\n    But because excess sodium can lead to heart failure, especially in older adults, it's important to check with your doctor before increasing the salt in your diet.\n    \n    Drink more water. Fluids increase blood volume and help prevent dehydration, both of which are important in treating hypotension.\n    \n    Wear compression stockings. The elastic stockings commonly used to relieve the pain and swelling of varicose veins can help reduce the pooling of blood in your legs.\n    Some people tolerate elastic abdominal binders better than they do compression stockings.\n    \n    \n    Medications. Several medications can be used to treat low blood pressure that occurs when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension). For example, the drug fludrocortisone, which boosts your blood volume, is often used to treat this form of low blood pressure.\n    Doctors often use the drug midodrine (Orvaten) to raise standing blood pressure levels in people with chronic orthostatic hypotension.

Some of the more common knee injuries include:\n\n    ACL injury. An ACL injury is a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) \u2014 one of four ligaments that connect your shinbone to your thighbone. An ACL injury is particularly common in people who play basketball, soccer or other sports that require sudden changes in direction.\n    Fractures. The bones of the knee, including the kneecap (patella), can be broken during falls or auto accidents. Also, people whose bones have been weakened by osteoporosis can sometimes sustain a knee fracture simply by stepping wrong.\n    Torn meniscus. The meniscus is the tough, rubbery cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between your shinbone and thighbone. It can be torn if you suddenly twist your knee while bearing weight on it.\n    Knee bursitis. Some knee injuries cause inflammation in the bursae, the small sacs of fluid that cushion the outside of your knee joint so that tendons and ligaments glide smoothly over the joint.\n    Patellar tendinitis. Tendinitis causes irritation and inflammation of one or more tendons \u2014 the thick, fibrous tissues that attach muscles to bones. This inflammation can happen when there's an injury to the patellar tendon, which runs from the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone and allows you to kick, run and jump. Runners, skiers, cyclists, and those involved in jumping sports and activities may develop patellar tendinitis.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Mechanical problemsSome examples of mechanical problems that can cause knee pain include:\n\n    Loose body. Sometimes injury or degeneration of bone or cartilage can cause a piece of bone or cartilage to break off and float in the joint space. This may not create any problems unless the loose body interferes with knee joint movement, in which case the effect is something like a pencil caught in a door hinge.\n    Iliotibial band syndrome. This occurs when the tough band of tissue that extends from the outside of your hip to the outside of your knee (iliotibial band) becomes so tight that it rubs against the outer portion of your thighbone. Distance runners and cyclists are especially susceptible to iliotibial band syndrome.\n    Dislocated kneecap. This occurs when the triangular bone that covers the front of your knee (patella) slips out of place, usually to the outside of your knee. In some cases, the kneecap may stay displaced and you'll be able to see the dislocation.\n    Hip or foot pain. If you have hip or foot pain, you may change the way you walk to spare your painful joint. But this altered gait can place more stress on your knee joint and cause knee pain.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Types of arthritisMore than 100 different types of arthritis exist. The varieties most likely to affect the knee include:\n\n    Osteoarthritis. Sometimes called degenerative arthritis, osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It's a wear-and-tear condition that occurs when the cartilage in your knee deteriorates with use and age.\n    Rheumatoid arthritis. The most debilitating form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that can affect almost any joint in your body, including your knees. Although rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease, it tends to vary in severity and may even come and go.\n    Gout. This type of arthritis occurs when uric acid crystals build up in the joint. While gout most commonly affects the big toe, it can also occur in the knee.\n    Pseudogout. Often mistaken for gout, pseudogout is caused by calcium-containing crystals that develop in the joint fluid. Knees are the most common joint affected by pseudogout.\n    Septic arthritis. Sometimes your knee joint can become infected, leading to swelling, pain and redness. Septic arthritis often occurs with a fever, and there's usually no trauma before the onset of pain. Septic arthritis can quickly cause extensive damage to the knee cartilage. If you have knee pain with any of the symptoms of septic arthritis, see your doctor right away.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Other problemsPatellofemoral pain syndrome is a general term that refers to pain arising between the kneecap and the underlying thighbone. It's common in athletes; in young adults, especially those whose kneecap doesn't track properly in its groove; and in older adults, who usually develop the condition as a result of arthritis of the kneecap.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "During the physical exam, your doctor is likely to:\n\n    Inspect your knee for swelling, pain, tenderness, warmth and visible bruising\n    Check to see how far you can move your lower leg in different directions\n    Push on or pull the joint to evaluate the integrity of the structures in your knee\n\n        \n            \n            Imaging testsIn some cases, your doctor might suggest tests such as:\n\n    X-ray. Your doctor may first recommend having an X-ray, which can help detect bone fractures and degenerative joint disease.\n    Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scanners combine X-rays taken from many different angles to create cross-sectional images of the inside of your body. CT scans can help diagnose bone problems and subtle fractures. A special kind of CT scan can accurately identify gout even when the joint is not inflamed.\n    Ultrasound. This technology uses sound waves to produce real-time images of the soft tissue structures within and around your knee. Your doctor may want to move your knee into different positions during the ultrasound to check for specific problems.\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses radio waves and a powerful magnet to create 3D images of the inside of your knee. This test is particularly useful in revealing injuries to soft tissues such as ligaments, tendons, cartilage and muscles.\n\n        \n            \n            Lab testsIf your doctor suspects an infection or inflammation, you're likely to have blood tests and sometimes a procedure called arthrocentesis, in which a small amount of fluid is removed from within your knee joint with a needle and sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatments will vary, depending upon what exactly is causing your knee pain.\n        \n            \n            MedicationsYour doctor may prescribe medications to help relieve pain and to treat the conditions causing your knee pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout.\n        \n            \n            TherapyStrengthening the muscles around your knee will make it more stable. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy or different types of strengthening exercises based on the specific condition that is causing your pain.\nIf you are physically active or practice a sport, you may need exercises to correct movement patterns that may be affecting your knees and to establish good technique during your sport or activity. Exercises to improve your flexibility and balance also are important.\nArch supports, sometimes with wedges on one side of the heel, can help shift pressure away from the side of the knee most affected by osteoarthritis. In certain conditions, different types of braces may be used to help protect and support the knee joint.\n        \n            \n            InjectionsIn some cases, your doctor may suggest injecting medications or other substances directly into your joint. Examples include:\n\n    Corticosteroids. Injections of a corticosteroid drug into your knee joint may help reduce the symptoms of an arthritis flare and provide pain relief that may last a few months. These injections aren't effective in all cases.\n    Hyaluronic acid. A thick fluid, similar to the fluid that naturally lubricates joints, hyaluronic acid can be injected into your knee to improve mobility and ease pain. Although study results have been mixed about the effectiveness of this treatment, relief from one or a series of shots may last as long as six months.\n    Platelet-rich plasma (PRP). PRP contains a concentration of many different growth factors that appear to reduce inflammation and promote healing. Some studies have found that PRP may benefit certain people with osteoarthritis, but more studies are needed.\n\n        \n            \n            SurgeryIf you have an injury that may require surgery, it's usually not necessary to have the operation immediately. Before making a decision, consider the pros and cons of both nonsurgical rehabilitation and surgical reconstruction in relation to what's most important to you. If you choose to have surgery, your options may include:\n\n    Arthroscopic surgery. Depending on your injury, your doctor may be able to examine and repair your joint damage using a fiber-optic camera and long, narrow tools inserted through just a few small incisions around your knee. Arthroscopy may be used to remove loose bodies from your knee joint, remove or repair damaged cartilage (especially if it is causing your knee to lock), and reconstruct torn ligaments.\n    Partial knee replacement surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon replaces only the most damaged portion of your knee with parts made of metal and plastic. The surgery can usually be performed through small incisions, so you're likely to heal more quickly than you are with surgery to replace your entire knee.\n    Total knee replacement. In this procedure, your surgeon cuts away damaged bone and cartilage from your thighbone, shinbone and kneecap, and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal alloys, high-grade plastics and polymers.\n    Osteotomy. This procedure involves removing bone from the thighbone or shinbone to better align the knee and relieve arthritis pain. This surgery may help you delay or avoid total knee replacement surgery.\n\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

The errors tell the cell to continue multiplying rapidly.\nBecause cancer cells don't mature and then die as normal cells do, they accumulate, eventually overwhelming production of healthy cells. In the bone marrow \u2014 the soft, blood-producing tissue that fills in the center of most of your bones \u2014 Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells crowd out healthy blood cells.\nWaldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells continue trying to produce antibodies, as healthy white blood cells do, but instead they produce abnormal proteins that the body can't use. The protein immunoglobulin M (IgM) accumulates in the blood, impairs circulation and causes complications.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Tests and procedures used to diagnose Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia include:\n\n    \n    Blood tests. Blood tests may reveal low numbers of healthy blood cells. Also, blood tests are used to detect the IgM proteins produced by the cancer cells.\n    Blood tests may also measure your organ function, which can tell your doctor whether the IgM proteins are affecting your organs, such as your kidneys and your liver.\n    \n    Collecting a sample of bone marrow for testing. During a bone marrow biopsy, your doctor uses a needle to extract some of your bone marrow from your hipbone. The sample is examined to look for cancer cells. If any are detected, advanced laboratory analysis can help your doctor understand the cancer cells' characteristics, including their genetic mutations.\n    Imaging tests. Imaging tests can help your doctor determine whether cancer has spread to other areas of your body. Imaging tests may include computerized tomography (CT) scans or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

Your doctor may recommend blood tests every few months to monitor your condition. You may go years without needing further treatment.\n    Plasma exchange. If you experience signs and symptoms related to having too many IgM proteins in your blood, your doctor may recommend plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) to remove the proteins and replace them with healthy blood plasma.\n    \n    Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that kills quickly growing cells, such as the abnormal blood cells produced by Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.\n    Chemotherapy may be used alone or combined with other drug treatments as an initial treatment for people who experience signs and symptoms of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. High-dose chemotherapy may also be used to suppress your bone marrow production in preparation for a bone marrow transplant.\n    \n    Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy drugs kill cancer cells by focusing on the specific abnormalities present in the cancer cells that allow them to survive. Targeted therapy drugs may be used alone or combined with other medications, such as chemotherapy or biological therapy, as an initial treatment for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or in cases where the cancer returns despite treatment.\n    Biological therapy. Biological therapy drugs use your immune system to kill cancer cells. Biological therapy drugs can be used alone or in combination with other medications as an initial treatment or as a treatment for recurrent Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.\n    Bone marrow transplant. In certain highly selected situations, a bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used to treat Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. During this procedure, high doses of chemotherapy are used to wipe out your diseased bone marrow. Healthy blood stem cells are infused into your body where they can rebuild healthy bone marrow.\n    Clinical trials.

Experienced doctors will select the best biopsy technique to ensure proper surgical treatment and planning. Options include:\n\n    Core needle biopsy. Tiny tubes of tumor material can be obtained by this method. Doctors typically try to take samples from several sections of the tumor.\n    Surgical biopsy. In some cases, your doctor might suggest surgery to obtain a larger sample of tissue or to simply remove a small tumor entirely.\n\nIn the lab, a doctor trained in analyzing body tissues (pathologist) examines the tissue sample for signs of cancer.

When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created.\n\nHow likely you are to develop osteoporosis depends partly on how much bone mass you attained in your youth. Peak bone mass is somewhat inherited and varies also by ethnic group. The higher your peak bone mass, the more bone you have \"in the bank\" and the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis as you age.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your bone density can be measured by a machine that uses low levels of X-rays to determine the proportion of mineral in your bones.

Examples include:\n\n\nAlendronate (Binosto, Fosamax)\nRisedronate (Actonel, Atelvia)\nIbandronate (Boniva)\nZoledronic acid (Reclast, Zometa)\n\n\nSide effects include nausea, abdominal pain and heartburn-like symptoms. These are less likely to occur if the medicine is taken properly.\n\nIntravenous forms of bisphosphonates don't cause stomach upset but can cause fever, headache and muscle aches for up to three days. It might be easier to schedule a quarterly or yearly injection than to remember to take a weekly or monthly pill, but it can be more costly to do so.\n\n        \n            \n            Monoclonal antibody medicationsCompared with bisphosphonates, denosumab (Prolia, Xgeva) produces similar or better bone density results and reduces the chance of all types of fractures. Denosumab is delivered via a shot under the skin every six months.\n\nIf you take denosumab, you might have to continue to do so indefinitely. Recent research indicates there could be a high risk of spinal column fractures after stopping the drug.\n\nA very rare complication of bisphosphonates and denosumab is a break or crack in the middle of the thighbone.\n\nA second rare complication is delayed healing of the jawbone (osteonecrosis of the jaw). This can occur after an invasive dental procedure such as removing a tooth.\n\nYou should have a dental examination before starting these medications, and you should continue to take good care of your teeth and see your dentist regularly while on them. Make sure your dentist knows that you're taking these medications. \n\n        \n            \n            Hormone-related therapyEstrogen, especially when started soon after menopause, can help maintain bone density. However, estrogen therapy can increase the risk of blood clots, endometrial cancer, breast cancer and possibly heart disease. Therefore, estrogen is typically used for bone health in younger women or in women whose menopausal symptoms also require treatment.\n\nRaloxifene (Evista) mimics estrogen's beneficial effects on bone density in postmenopausal women, without some of the risks associated with estrogen. Taking this drug can reduce the risk of some types of breast cancer. Hot flashes are a common side effect. Raloxifene also may increase your risk of blood clots.\n\nIn men, osteoporosis might be linked with a gradual age-related decline in testosterone levels. Testosterone replacement therapy can help improve symptoms of low testosterone, but osteoporosis medications have been better studied in men to treat osteoporosis and thus are recommended alone or in addition to testosterone. \n\n        \n            \n            Bone-building medicationsIf you can't tolerate the more common treatments for osteoporosis \u2014 or if they don't work well enough \u2014 your doctor might suggest trying:\n\n    Teriparatide (Forteo). This powerful drug is similar to parathyroid hormone and stimulates new bone growth. It's given by daily injection under the skin. After two years of treatment with teriparatide, another osteoporosis drug is taken to maintain the new bone growth.\n    Abaloparatide (Tymlos) is another drug similar to parathyroid hormone. You can take it for only two years, which will be followed by another osteoporosis medication.\n    Romosozumab (Evenity). This is the newest bone-building medication to treat osteoporosis. It is given as an injection every month at your doctor's office.

A tonometry exam measures the pressure inside your eye (intraocular pressure). Numbing eyedrops may be used for this test.\n    A slit-lamp examination. A slit lamp is a microscope that magnifies and illuminates the front of your eye with an intense line of light. This evaluation is necessary to identify microscopic inflammatory cells in the front of the eye.\n    Ophthalmoscopy.

This test measures the thickness of the retina and choroid to reveal inflammation in these layers.\n    Fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography. These tests require placement of an intravenous (IV) catheter in a vein in your arm in order to administer a dye. This dye will reach the blood vessels in the eyes and allow photographs of blood vessel inflammation inside the eyes.\n    Analysis of aqueous or vitreous fluid from the eye.\n    Blood tests.\n    Imaging tests, radiography, CT or MRI scans.\n\nIf the ophthalmologist thinks an underlying condition may be the cause of your uveitis, you may be referred to another doctor for a general medical examination and laboratory tests.\nSometimes, it's difficult to find a specific cause for uveitis. Even if a specific cause is not identified, uveitis can still be treated successfully. In the majority of cases, identifying a cause for the uveitis does not lead to a cure.

Usually the treatment for uveitis is the same regardless of the associated cause, as long as it is not infectious. The goal of treatment is to reduce the inflammation in your eye, as well as in other parts of the body, if present. In some cases, treatment may be necessary for months to years. Several treatment options are available.\n        \n            \n            Medications\n    Drugs that reduce inflammation. Your doctor may first prescribe eyedrops with an anti-inflammatory medication, such as a corticosteroid. Eyedrops are usually not enough to treat inflammation beyond the front of the eye, so a corticosteroid injection in or around the eye or corticosteroid tablets (taken by mouth) may be necessary.\n    Drugs that control spasms. Eyedrops that widen (dilate) the pupil may be prescribed to control spasms in the iris and ciliary body, which can help relieve eye pain.\n    Drugs that fight bacteria or viruses. If uveitis is caused by an infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, antiviral medications or other medicines, with or without corticosteroids, to bring the infection under control.\n    Drugs that affect the immune system or destroy cells. You may need immunosuppressive drugs if your uveitis affects both eyes, doesn't respond well to corticosteroids or becomes severe enough to threaten your vision.\n\nSome of these medications can have serious eye-related side effects, such as glaucoma and cataracts. Medications by mouth or injection can have side effects in other parts of the body outside the eyes. You may need to visit your doctor for follow-up examinations and blood tests every one to three months.\n        \n            \n            Surgical or other procedures\n    Vitrectomy. Surgery to remove some of the vitreous in your eye is rarely used to diagnose or manage the condition.\n    \n    A medication-releasing implant. For people with difficult-to-treat posterior uveitis, a device that's implanted in the eye may be an option. This device slowly releases corticosteroid into the eye for two to three years.\n    Cataracts usually develop in people who have not yet had cataract surgery. Up to 30% of patients will also require treatment for elevated eye pressure to prevent the development of glaucoma.\n    \n\nThe speed of your recovery depends in part on the type of uveitis you have and the severity of your symptoms. Uveitis that affects the back of your eye (posterior uveitis or panuveitis, including retinitis or choroiditis) tends to heal more slowly than uveitis in the front of the eye (anterior uveitis or iritis).

The amount of bleeding varies from one person to another, depending on the type and severity of the disease.\nIf you have von Willebrand disease, you might have:\n\n    Excessive bleeding from an injury or after surgery or dental work\n    Nosebleeds that don't stop within 10 minutes\n    Heavy or long menstrual bleeding\n    Blood in your urine or stool\n    Easy bruising or lumpy bruises\n\nMenstrual signs and symptoms may include:\n\n    Blood clots greater than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter in your menstrual flow\n    The need to change your menstrual pad or tampon more than once an hour\n    The need to use double sanitary protection for menstrual flow\n    Symptoms of anemia, including tiredness, fatigue or shortness of breath\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            When to see a doctorContact your doctor if you have bleeding that lasts a long time or is hard to stop.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "The usual cause of von Willebrand disease is an inherited abnormal gene that controls von Willebrand factor \u2014 a protein that plays a key role in blood clotting.\nWhen you have low levels of this protein or it doesn't work as it should, small blood cells called platelets cannot stick together properly nor attach themselves normally to the blood vessel walls when an injury has occurred. This interferes with the clotting process and can sometimes cause uncontrolled bleeding.\nMany people with von Willebrand disease also have low levels of factor VIII, another protein that helps in clotting.\nFactor VIII is involved in another inherited clotting disorder called hemophilia. But unlike hemophilia, which mainly affects males, von Willebrand disease affects males and females and is usually milder.\nRarely, von Willebrand disease can develop later in life in people who didn't inherit an abnormal gene from a parent. This is known as acquired von Willebrand syndrome, and it's likely caused by an underlying medical condition.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Mild forms of von Willebrand disease can be difficult to diagnose because bleeding is common, and, for most people, doesn't indicate a disease. However, if your doctor suspects you have a bleeding disorder, he or she might refer you to a blood disorders specialist (hematologist).\nTo evaluate you for von Willebrand disease, your doctor will likely ask you detailed questions about your medical history and check for bruises or other signs of recent bleeding.\nYour doctor will also likely recommend the following blood tests:\n\n    Von Willebrand factor antigen. This determines the level of von Willebrand factor in your blood by measuring a particular protein.\n    Von Willebrand factor activity. There are a variety of tests to measure how well the von Willebrand factor works in your clotting process.\n    Factor VIII clotting activity. This shows whether you have abnormally low levels and activity of factor VIII.\n    Von Willebrand factor multimers. This evaluates the structure of von Willebrand factor in your blood, its protein complexes and how its molecules break down. This information helps identify the type of von Willebrand disease you have.\n\nThe results of these tests can fluctuate in the same person over time due to factors such as stress, exercise, infection, pregnancy and medications. So you might need to repeat some tests.\nIf you have von Willebrand disease, your doctor might suggest that family members undergo tests to determine if this condition runs in your family.\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Even though von Willebrand disease has no cure, treatment can help prevent or stop bleeding episodes. Your treatment depends on:\n\n    The type and severity of your condition\n    How you've responded to previous therapy\n    Your other medications and conditions\n\nYour doctor might suggest one or more of the following treatments to increase your von Willebrand factor, strengthen blood clots or, in women, control heavy menstrual bleeding:\n\n    \n    Desmopressin. This medication is available as an injection (DDAVP) or nasal spray (Minirin) It's a synthetic hormone that controls bleeding by stimulating your body to release more of the von Willebrand factor stored in the lining of your blood vessels.\n    Many doctors consider DDAVP the first treatment for managing von Willebrand disease. Some women use the nasal spray at the beginning of their menstrual periods to control excessive bleeding. It can also be effective when used before a minor surgical procedure.\n    \n    Replacement therapies. These include infusions of concentrated blood-clotting factors containing von Willebrand factor and factor VIII. Your doctor might recommend them if DDAVP isn't an option for you or was ineffective.\n    Another replacement therapy approved by the FDA for treating adults 18 and older is a genetically engineered (recombinant) von Willebrand factor product. Because recombinant factor is made without plasma, it can reduce the risk of a viral infection or allergic reaction.\n    \n    Oral contraceptives. For women, these can be useful for controlling heavy bleeding during menstrual periods. The estrogen hormones in birth control pills can boost von Willebrand factor and factor VIII activity. This effect is likely available with birth control patches, though further study is needed to confirm it.\n    Clot-stabilizing medications. These anti-fibrinolytic medications \u2014 such as aminocaproic acid (Amicar) and tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron, Lysteda) \u2014 can help stop bleeding by slowing the breakdown of blood clots. Doctors often prescribe these drugs before or after a surgical procedure or tooth extraction.\n    Drugs applied to cuts. A fibrin sealant (Tisseel VHSD) placed on a cut helps curtail bleeding. This is applied like glue using a syringe. There are also over-the-counter products to stop nosebleeds.\n\nIf your condition is mild, your doctor might recommend treatment only when you're having surgery or dental work or when you've had a trauma, such as a car accident.\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n    "},

He or she can assess your skin and help you create a personalized skin care plan. A dermatologist can also recommend medical wrinkle treatments.\r\n        \r\n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\r\n    \r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Causes": "Wrinkles are caused by a combination of factors \u2014 some you can control, others you can't:\n\n    \n    Age. As you get older, your skin naturally becomes less elastic and more fragile. Decreased production of natural oils dries your skin and makes it appear more wrinkled.\n    Fat in the deeper layers of your skin diminishes. This causes loose, saggy skin and more-pronounced lines and crevices.\n    \n    \n    Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. Ultraviolet radiation, which speeds the natural aging process, is the primary cause of early wrinkling. Exposure to UV light breaks down your skin's connective tissue \u2014 collagen and elastin fibers, which lie in the deeper layer of skin (dermis).\n    Without the supportive connective tissue, your skin loses strength and flexibility. Skin then begins to sag and wrinkle prematurely.\n    \n    Smoking. Smoking can accelerate the normal aging process of your skin, contributing to wrinkles. This may be due to smoking's effect on collagen.\n    Repeated facial expressions. Facial movements and expressions, such as squinting or smiling, lead to fine lines and wrinkles. Each time you use a facial muscle, a groove forms beneath the surface of the skin. And as skin ages, it loses its flexibility and is no longer able to spring back in place. These grooves then become permanent features on your face.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "", "Treatment": "Several wrinkle treatment options are available to help smooth wrinkles or make them less noticeable.\n        \n            \n            Medications\n    \n    Topical retinoids. Prescription medicine that contains retinoids, which is derived from vitamin A, may reduce fine wrinkles, splotches and roughness when applied to the skin. You may need to use the product for a few weeks or months before you notice improvement. Products include tretinoin (Renova, Retin-A) and tazarotene (Avage, Tazorac), and a synthetic version called adapalene is also an option. Retinoids might cause temporary itching, redness, burning or dryness.\n    Because retinoids can make your skin burn more easily, you'll need to daily use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 and wear protective clothing.\n    \n    \n    Nonprescription wrinkle creams. The effectiveness of anti-wrinkle creams depends in part on the active ingredients. Retinol, antioxidants and some peptides may result in slight to modest improvements in wrinkles.\n    With nonprescription wrinkle creams, your results, if any, are limited and usually short-lived because these creams contain less of the active ingredients than do prescription creams.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Surgical procedures and other techniquesA variety of procedures are used to smooth out wrinkles. Some studies indicate that a combination of treatments may yield the most satisfying results. Talk with your doctor about what's important to you and which approach would best meet your needs and expectations as far as recovery time and results.\n\n    \n    Laser resurfacing. In ablative (wounding) laser resurfacing, a laser beam destroys the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and heats the underlying skin (dermis). This stimulates the growth of new collagen fibers. As the wound heals, smoother, tighter skin forms. Laser resurfacing can't eliminate excessive or sagging skin.\n    Laser resurfacing may be done as an outpatient procedure, usually with a local anesthetic. You may be fully sedated for extensive resurfacing. It can take several months to fully heal from ablative laser resurfacing. A newer method using fractional lasers has a shorter recovery time. Risks include scarring and lightening or darkening of skin color.\n    A technique called nonablative laser fractional resurfacing has a shorter healing time and fewer risks than does the ablative technique. Nonablative lasers are better suited to people with moderate wrinkles because results are subtle. This treatment needs to be repeated more often than does ablative treatment. This method also can be done with a fractional laser.\n    \n    Photodynamic rejuvenation. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can treat fine wrinkles caused by sun exposure. You may need repeat treatments, but recovery for PDT is shorter than it is with laser resurfacing.\n    Chemical peel. Your doctor applies a chemical solution to the skin to remove the top layers. The skin that grows back after a chemical peel is smother. Depending on the depth of the peel, you may need several treatments before you see a difference in your skin. Redness lasts up to several weeks. Possible side effects include scarring, infection, and lightening or darkening of skin color.\n    \n    Dermabrasion. Dermabrasion sands down the surface layer of skin with a rapidly rotating brush. New skin grows in its place. You may need to undergo the procedure more than once.\n    Possible side effects include temporary redness, scabbing and swelling. It may take several months for pinkness to fade and for you to see results.\n    \n    \n    Microdermabrasion. Similar to dermabrasion, this technique removes only a fine layer of skin. You'll need a series of treatments over months to produce modest, temporary results. If you have rosacea or tiny red veins on your face, this technique could make the condition worse.\n    You may notice a slight redness or stinging sensation on the treated areas.\n    \n    \n    Botulinum toxin type A (Botox). When injected in small doses into specific muscles, Botox keeps the muscles from contracting. When the muscles can't tighten, the skin appears smoother and less wrinkled.\n    Botox works well on frown lines between the eyebrows and across the forehead and on crow's-feet at the eye corners. It takes one to three days to see results. The effect typically lasts a few months. Repeat injections are needed to maintain results.\n    \n    Soft tissue fillers. Soft tissue fillers, which include fat, collagen and hyaluronic acid (Restylane, Juvederm, others), can be injected into wrinkles on your face. They plump and smooth wrinkles and furrows. You may experience temporary swelling, redness and bruising in the treated area. The effect of most products is temporary.\n    \n    Face-lift. The face-lift procedure involves tightening the underlying muscle and tissues. It may be done in a hospital or an outpatient surgical facility, with a local anesthetic, sedation or general anesthesia. Healing times can be lengthy after a face-lift. Bruising and swelling are usually evident for several weeks after surgery.\n    Face-lift results are not permanent. You may choose to undergo another face-lift several years later.\n    \n\nKeep in mind that results vary depending on the location and depth of your wrinkles. Nothing stops the aging process of skin, so you'll likely need repeated treatments to maintain benefits.\nThese procedures aren't usually covered by insurance. Also, any of the procedures can have side effects, so be sure to discuss them with your doctor. Make sure your dermatologist or plastic surgeon is specially trained and experienced in the technique you're considering.More InformationWrinkles care at Mayo ClinicWrinkle creamsBotox injectionsChemical peelDermabrasionFace-liftFacial fillers for wrinklesLaser resurfacingNeck liftShow more related information\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

But the sequence of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is clear. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors (gastrinomas) form in your pancreas or duodenum or at other sites such as the lymph nodes adjacent to your pancreas.\nYour pancreas sits behind and below your stomach. It produces enzymes that are essential to digesting food. The pancreas also produces several hormones including insulin, a hormone that helps to control your blood glucose.\nDigestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum, the part of the small intestine next to your stomach. This is where digestion reaches its peak.\nThe tumors that occur with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are made up of cells that secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Increased gastrin makes the stomach produce far too much acid. The excess acid then leads to peptic ulcers and sometimes to diarrhea.\nBesides causing excess acid production, the tumors are often cancerous (malignant). Although the tumors tend to grow slowly, the cancer can spread elsewhere \u2014 most commonly to nearby lymph nodes or your liver.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Association with MEN 1Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may be caused by an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1). People with MEN 1 also have tumors in the parathyroid glands and may have tumors in their pituitary glands.\nAbout 25% of people who have gastrinomas have them as part of Men 1. They may also have tumors in the pancreas and other organs.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will base a diagnosis on the following:\n\n    Medical history. Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and review your medical history.\n    \n    Blood tests. A sample of your blood is analyzed to see whether you have elevated gastrin levels. While elevated gastrin may indicate tumors in your pancreas or duodenum, it can also be caused by other conditions. For example, gastrin may also be elevated if your stomach isn't making acid, or you're taking acid-reducing medications, such as proton pump inhibitors.\n    You need to fast before this test and may need to stop taking any acid-reducing medications to get the most accurate measure of your gastrin levels. Because gastrin levels can fluctuate, this test may be repeated a few times.\n    Your doctor may also perform a secretin stimulation test. For this test, your doctor first measures your gastrin levels, then gives you an injection of the hormone secretin and measures gastrin levels again. If you have Zollinger-Ellison, your gastrin levels will increase even more.\n    \n    Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. After you're sedated, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible instrument with a light and video camera (endoscope) down your throat and into your stomach and duodenum to look for ulcers. Through the endoscope, your doctor may remove a tissue sample (biopsy) from your duodenum to help detect the presence of gastrin-producing tumors. Your doctor will ask you not to eat anything after midnight the night before the test.\n    \n    Endoscopic ultrasound. In this procedure, your doctor examines your stomach, duodenum and pancreas with an endoscope fitted with an ultrasound probe. The probe allows for closer inspection, making it easier to spot tumors.\n    It's also possible to remove a tissue sample through the endoscope. You'll need to fast after midnight the night before this test, and you'll be sedated during the test.\n    \n    Imaging tests. Your doctor may use imaging techniques such as a nuclear scan called somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. This test uses radioactive tracers to help locate tumors. Other helpful imaging tests include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT scanning.\nMore InformationCT scanEndoscopic ultrasoundMRIUltrasoundShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "Treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome addresses the hormone-secreting tumors as well as the ulcers they cause.\n        \n            \n            Treatment of tumorsAn operation to remove the tumors that occur in Zollinger-Ellison requires a skilled surgeon because the tumors are often small and difficult to locate. If you have just one tumor, your doctor may be able to remove it surgically, but surgery may not be an option if you have multiple tumors or tumors that have spread to your liver. On the other hand, even if you have multiple tumors, your doctor still may recommend removing a single large tumor.\nIn some cases, doctors advise other treatments to control tumor growth, including:\n\n    Removing as much of a liver tumor as possible (debulking)\n    Attempting to destroy the tumor by cutting off the blood supply (embolization) or by using heat to destroy cancer cells (radiofrequency ablation)\n    Injecting drugs into the tumor to relieve cancer symptoms\n    Using chemotherapy to try to slow tumor growth\n    Having a liver transplant\n\n        \n            \n            Treatment of excess acidExcess acid production can almost always be controlled. Medications known as proton pump inhibitors are the first line of treatment. These are effective medications for decreasing acid production in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\nProton pump inhibitors are powerful drugs that reduce acid by blocking the action of the tiny \"pumps\" within acid-secreting cells. Commonly prescribed medications include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and esomeprazole (Nexium).\nLong-term use of prescription proton pump inhibitors, especially in people age 50 and older, has been associated with an increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist and spine, according to the Food and Drug Administration. This risk is small and should be weighed against the acid-blocking benefits of these medications.\nOctreotide (Sandostatin), a medication similar to the hormone somatostatin, may counteract the effects of gastrin and be helpful for some people.More InformationChemotherapyLiver transplantRadiofrequency ablation for cancer\n        \n            Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n    \n\n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n            "},

Doctors often don't know the cause of vocal cord paralysis. Known causes may include:\n\n    Injury to the vocal cord during surgery. Surgery on or near your neck or upper chest can result in damage to the nerves that serve your voice box. Surgeries that carry a risk of damage include surgeries to the thyroid or parathyroid glands, esophagus, neck, and chest.\n    Neck or chest injury. Trauma to your neck or chest may injure the nerves that serve your vocal cords or the voice box itself.\n    Stroke. A stroke interrupts blood flow in your brain and may damage the part of your brain that sends messages to the voice box.\n    Tumors. Tumors, both cancerous and noncancerous, can grow in or around the muscles, cartilage or nerves controlling the function of your voice box and can cause vocal cord paralysis.\n    Infections. Some infections, such as Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr virus and herpes, can cause inflammation and directly damage the nerves in the larynx.\n    Neurological conditions. If you have certain neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, you may experience vocal cord paralysis.\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and lifestyle, listen to your voice, and ask you how long you've had voice problems. To further evaluate your voice problems, the following tests may be performed:\n\n    \n    Laryngoscopy. Your doctor will look at your vocal cords using a mirror or a thin, flexible tube (known as a laryngoscope or endoscope) or both. You may also have a test called videostrobolaryngoscopy that's done using a special scope that contains a tiny camera at its tip or a larger camera connected to the scope's viewing piece.\n    These special high-magnification endoscopes allow your doctor to view your vocal cords directly or on a video monitor to determine the movement and position of the vocal cords and whether one or both vocal cords are affected.\n    \n    \n    Laryngeal electromyography. This test measures the electric currents in your voice box muscles. To obtain these measurements, your doctor typically inserts small needles into your vocal cord muscles through the skin of the neck.\n    This test doesn't usually provide information that might change the course of treatment, but it may give your doctor information about how well you may recover. This test is most useful for predicting how you'll recover when it's done between six weeks and six months after your symptoms began.\n    \n    Blood tests and scans.

Treatment may include voice therapy, bulk injections, surgery or a combination of treatments.\nIn some instances, you may get better without surgical treatment. For this reason, your doctor may delay permanent surgery for at least a year from the beginning of your vocal cord paralysis.\nHowever, surgical treatment with bulk injections containing collagen-like substances is often done within the first 3 months of voice loss.\nDuring the waiting period for surgery, your doctor may suggest voice therapy to help keep you from using your voice improperly while the nerves heal.\n\n        \n            \n            Voice therapyVoice therapy sessions involve exercises or other activities to strengthen your vocal cords, improve breath control during speech, prevent abnormal tension in other muscles around the paralyzed vocal cord or cords and protect your airway during swallowing. Occasionally, voice therapy may be the only treatment you need if your vocal cords were paralyzed in a location that doesn't require additional bulk or repositioning.\n        \n            \n            SurgeryIf your vocal cord paralysis symptoms don't fully recover on their own, surgical treatments may be offered to improve your ability to speak and to swallow.\nSurgical options include:\n\n    Bulk injection. Paralysis of the nerve to your vocal cord will probably leave the vocal cord muscle thin and weak. To add bulk to a paralyzed vocal cord, a doctor who specializes in disorders of the larynx (laryngologist) may inject your vocal cord with a substance such as body fat, collagen or another approved filler substance. This added bulk brings the affected vocal cord closer to the middle of your voice box so that the opposite functioning and moving vocal cord can make closer contact with the paralyzed cord when you speak, swallow or cough.\n    Structural implants. Instead of using a bulk injection, this procedure \u2014 known as thyroplasty, medialization laryngoplasty or laryngeal framework surgery \u2014 relies on the use of an implant in the larynx to reposition the vocal cord. Rarely, people who have this surgery may need to have a second surgery to reposition the implant.\n    Vocal cord repositioning. In this procedure, a surgeon moves a window of your own tissue from the outside of your voice box inward, pushing the paralyzed vocal cord toward the middle of your voice box. This allows your unimpaired vocal cord to better vibrate against its paralyzed partner.\n    Replacing the damaged nerve (reinnervation). In this surgery, a healthy nerve is moved from a different area of the neck to replace the damaged vocal cord. It can take as long as six to nine months before the voice improves. Some doctors combine this surgery with a bulk injection.\n    \n    Tracheotomy. If both of your vocal cords are paralyzed and positioned closely together, your airflow will be decreased. In this situation, you'll have a lot of trouble breathing and require a surgical procedure called a tracheotomy.\n    In a tracheotomy, an incision is made in the front of your neck and an opening created directly into the windpipe (trachea). A breathing tube is inserted, allowing air to bypass the immobilized vocal cords.\n    \n\n        \n            \n            Emerging treatmentsLinking the vocal cords to an alternative source of electrical stimulation \u2014 perhaps a nerve from another part of the body or a device similar to a cardiac pacemaker \u2014 may restore opening and closing of the vocal cords.

Experts suspect that defective genes play a role. But it's usually not known whether such genetic defects are inherited or simply develop over time. Or, they might be caused by something in the environment, such as exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nMost vertebral tumors are metastatic, which means they have spread from tumors in organs elsewhere in the body. Any type of cancer can travel to the spine, but common tumor spread from the breast, lung and prostate are more likely than others to spread to the spine. Cancers of the bone, such as multiple myeloma, also may spread to the spine.\n \nVertebral tumors are also more common in people who have a prior history of cancer. \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Vertebral tumors sometimes may be overlooked because their symptoms resemble those of more-common conditions. For that reason, it's especially important that your doctor know your complete medical history and perform both general physical and neurological exams.\t\n\n    \n    Spinal tumor consultation\n    \n\n\n\n        \n            \n            If your doctor suspects a vertebral tumor, one or more of the following tests can help confirm the diagnosis and pinpoint the tumor's location:\n\n\nSpinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to produce accurate images of your spine, spinal cord and nerves. MRI is usually the preferred test to diagnose vertebral tumors. A contrast agent that helps to highlight certain tissues and structures may be injected into a vein in your hand or forearm during the test.\n\nSome people may feel claustrophobic inside the MRI scanner or find the loud thumping sound it makes disturbing. Earplugs, televisions or headphones can be used to help minimize the noise. Mild sedatives are frequently used to relieve the anxiety of claustrophobia.\n\n\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan. This test uses a narrow beam of radiation to produce detailed images of your spine. Sometimes it may be combined with an injected contrast dye to make abnormal changes in the spinal canal or spinal cord easier to see. CT scan may be used in combination with MRI.\nBiopsy. Often, the only way to determine the type of tumor is to examine a small tissue sample (biopsy) under a microscope. The biopsy results will help determine treatment options.\nThe method used to obtain the biopsy sample can be critical to the success of the overall treatment plan. You should thoroughly discuss the biopsy with your doctor as well as your surgical team to prevent potential complications. In most cases, a radiologist will conduct a fine-needle biopsy to extract a small amount of tissue, usually under the guidance of X-ray or CT imaging.\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n    \n    MRI scan\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCare at Mayo Clinic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your vertebral tumor-related health concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore InformationVertebral tumor care at Mayo ClinicCT scanMRINeedle biopsyShow more related information\n        \n            \n            ", "Treatment": "\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \n\t    Surgical vertebral tumor removal and reconstruction\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSurgical vertebral tumor removal and reconstruction\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSurgical vertebral tumor removal and reconstruction\n\t\t\t\tUsing microsurgical techniques, a tumor is gently teased out of the spinal cord in the cervical spine.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, the goal of vertebral tumor treatment is to completely get rid of the tumor. But, this might be complicated by the risk of permanent damage to the spinal cord or surrounding nerves. Doctors also must consider your age, overall health, the type of tumor, and whether it is primary or has spread or metastasized to your spine from elsewhere in your body.\n\nTreatment options for most vertebral tumors include:\n\n\nMonitoring. Some tumors may be discovered before they cause symptoms \u2014 often when you're being evaluated for another condition. If small tumors are noncancerous and aren't growing or pressing on surrounding tissues, watching them carefully may be all that's needed.\n\nThis is especially true in older adults for whom surgery or radiation therapy may pose special risks. During observation, your doctor will likely recommend periodic CT or MRI scans at an appropriate interval to monitor the tumor.\n\nSurgery. This is often the treatment of choice for tumors that can be removed with an acceptable risk of spinal cord or nerve injury.\n\nNewer techniques and instruments allow neurosurgeons to reach tumors that were once considered inaccessible.  Sometimes, surgeons may use a high-powered microscope in microsurgery to make it easier to distinguish a tumor from healthy tissue.\n\nDoctors can also monitor the function of the spinal cord and other important nerves during surgery, thus minimizing the chance of their being injured. In some instances, an ultrasound might be used during surgery to break up tumors and remove the fragments.\n\nBut even with advances in surgical techniques and technology, not all tumors can be totally removed. Sometimes, surgery might be followed by radiation therapy, chemotherapy or both.\n\nRecovery from spinal surgery may take weeks or longer, depending on the procedure or complications, such as bleeding and damage to nerve tissue.\n\n\nRadiation therapy. This may be used following an operation to eliminate the remnants of tumors that can't be completely removed, treat inoperable tumors or treat those tumors where surgery is too risky.\n\nIt may also be the first line therapy for some vertebral tumors. Radiation therapy may also be used to relieve pain when surgery is too risky.\n\nMedications may help ease some of the side effects of radiation, such as nausea and vomiting.\n\nSometimes, your radiation therapy regimen may be adjusted to help prevent damage to surrounding tissue from the radiation and improve the treatment's effectiveness. Modifications may range from simply changing the dosage of radiation to using sophisticated techniques such as 3-D conformal radiation therapy.\n\nA specialized type of radiation therapy called proton beam therapy also may be used to treat some vertebral tumors such as chordomas, chondrosarcomas and some childhood cancers when spinal radiation is required. Proton beam therapy can better target radioactive protons at the tumor site without damaging the surrounding tissue as in traditional radiation therapy.\n\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). This treatment, which isn't actually surgery, delivers a high dose of precisely targeted radiation. In SRS, doctors use computers to focus radiation beams on tumors with pinpoint accuracy and from multiple angles.\n\nThere are different types of technology used in radiosurgery to stereotactically deliver radiation to treat vertebral tumors.\n\nSRS has certain limits on the size and specific type of the tumors that can be treated. But when appropriate, it's been proved quite effective. Growing research supports its use for the treatment of spinal tumors.\n\nHowever, there are risks \u2014 such as an increased risk of vertebral fractures. Further study is needed to determine the best technique, radiation dose and schedule for SRS in the treatment of vertebral tumors.\n\n\nChemotherapy. A standard treatment for many types of cancer, chemotherapy uses medications to destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing. Your doctor can determine whether chemotherapy might be beneficial for you, either alone or in combination with other therapies.\n\nSide effects may include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, increased risk of infection and hair loss.\n\nOther drugs. Because surgery and radiation therapy as well as tumors themselves can cause inflammation inside the spinal cord, doctors sometimes prescribe corticosteroids to reduce the swelling, either following surgery or during radiation treatments.\n \nAlthough corticosteroids reduce inflammation, they are usually used only for short periods to avoid serious side effects such as muscle weakness, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, diabetes and an increased susceptibility to infection.\n\n \n\n\n\t\n\n    \n    SRS treatment\n    Stereotactic radiosurgery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \u00a0\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

These include:\n\n    Abnormalities of the heart that result in scarring of heart tissue (sometimes called \"structural heart disease\"), the most common cause is a prior heart attack\n    Poor blood flow to the heart muscle due to coronary artery disease\n    Congenital heart conditions, including long QT syndrome\n    Imbalance of electrolytes necessary for conducting electrical impulses\n    Medication side effects\n    Use of drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine\n\nIn some cases, the exact cause of ventricular tachycardia can't be determined (idiopathic ventricular tachycardia).\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            The heart's electrical system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t    Normal heartbeat\r\n\t    Open pop-up dialog box\r\n    \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tClose\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tNormal heartbeat\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tNormal heartbeat\r\n\t\t\t\tIn a normal heart rhythm, a cluster of cells at the sinus node sends out an electrical signal. The signal then travels through the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node and then passes into the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump out blood.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the causes of heart rate or rhythm problems such as tachycardia, it helps to understand how the heart's electrical system works.\nYour heart is made up of four chambers \u2014 two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Your heartbeat is normally controlled by a natural pacemaker called the sinus node, which is located in the right atrium. The sinus node produces electrical impulses that normally start each heartbeat.\nFrom the sinus node, electrical impulses travel across the atria, causing the atrial muscles to contract and pump blood into the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles).\nThe electrical impulses then arrive at a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node \u2014 usually the only pathway for signals to travel from the atria to the ventricles.\nThe AV node slows down the electrical signal before sending it to the ventricles. This slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood. When electrical impulses reach the muscles of the ventricles, they contract, causing them to pump blood either to the lungs or to the rest of the body.\nWhen anything disrupts this complex system, it can cause the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia) or with an irregular rhythm.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "\t\n\n    \n    Ventricular tachycardia consultation at Mayo Clinic\n    A thorough physical exam, medical history and testing are required to diagnose ventricular tachycardia.\n\n\nYour doctor will evaluate your symptoms, perform a physical examination, and ask you about your health habits and medical history.

Your doctor can look for patterns among the signals to determine what kind of tachycardia you have and how problems in the heart may be causing a fast heart rate.\nYour doctor may also ask you to use a portable ECG device at home to obtain more information about your heart rate. These devices include:\n\n    Holter monitor. You carry this portable ECG device in your pocket or wear it on a belt or shoulder strap. It records your heart's activity for an entire 24-hour period, which gives your doctor a prolonged look at your heart rhythms.

The sinus node sends electrical signals that normally start each heartbeat. These electrical signals move across the atria, causing the heart muscles to squeeze (contract) and pump blood into the ventricles.\nNext, the signals arrive at a cluster of cells called the AV node, where they slow down. This slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood. When the electrical signals reach the ventricles, the lower heart chambers contract and pump blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body.\nIn a healthy heart, this heart signaling process usually goes smoothly, resulting in a normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            The heart during ventricular fibrillationVentricular fibrillation is caused by either a problem in the heart's electrical properties or by a disruption of the normal blood supply to the heart muscle. Sometimes, the cause of ventricular fibrillation is unknown.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "Ventricular fibrillation is always diagnosed in an emergency situation. A pulse check will reveal no pulse if sudden cardiac death occurred.\nTests to diagnose and determine the cause of ventricular fibrillation include:\n\n    Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and painless test measures the electrical activity of your heart. Sticky patches (electrodes) are placed on your chest and sometimes your arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which displays the test results. An ECG can show if your heart is beating too fast, too slow or not at all. If you're having an episode of ventricular fibrillation, the ECG usually shows a heartbeat of about 300 to 400 beats a minute.\n    Blood tests. Blood tests can be done to check for enzymes that leak into the bloodstream when the heart is damaged by a heart attack.\n    Chest X-ray. An X-ray image of your chest allows your doctor to check the size and shape of your heart and its blood vessels.\n    Echocardiogram. This noninvasive test uses sound waves to produce images of your heart's size, structure and motion.\n    Coronary catheterization (angiogram). To determine if your coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked, a dye is injected through a long, thin tube (catheter) that's inserted through an artery, usually in your groin area, to the heart's arteries. The dye makes your arteries show up more clearly on X-ray, revealing areas of blockage.\n    Cardiac computerized tomography (CT). During a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and creates images of your heart and chest.\n    Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The goal of emergency treatment is to restore blood flow as quickly as possible to prevent organ and brain damage.\nEmergency treatment for ventricular fibrillation includes:\n\n\tCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR mimics the pumping motion of the heart and keeps blood flowing through the body. First call 911 or your local emergency number. Then start CPR by pushing hard and fast on the person's chest \u2014 about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. Let the chest rise completely between compressions. Continue CPR until an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available or emergency personnel arrive.\n\tDefibrillation. This treatment is also called cardioversion. An automated external defibrillator (AED) delivers shocks through the chest wall to the heart. It can help restore a normal heart rhythm. As soon as an AED is available, apply it and follow the prompts. If you're not trained to use an AED, a 911 operator or another emergency medical operator may be able to give you instructions.

The battery-powered device is implanted near your left collarbone during a minor surgery. One or more flexible, insulated wires (leads) from the ICD run through veins to your heart.\n    Cardiac ablation. This procedure uses heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in your heart to block the abnormal electrical signals that cause ventricular fibrillation. It's most often done using thin, flexible tubes called catheters inserted through the veins or arteries. It may also be done during heart surgery.\n    Coronary angioplasty and stent placement. If your ventricular fibrillation was caused by a heart attack, this procedure may reduce your risk of future episodes of ventricular fibrillation.\nDoctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) through an artery, usually in the groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. A balloon on the tip of the catheter briefly inflates to widen the artery, restoring blood flow to the heart. During the procedure, the doctor may place a metal mesh stent into the artery to help it stay open.\n    Coronary bypass surgery. This open-heart surgery improves blood flow to the heart. It may be done if your ventricular fibrillation was caused by coronary artery disease. During bypass surgery, the surgeon takes a healthy blood vessel from your leg, arm or chest and connects it below and above the blocked arteries in your heart.

Arteries carry blood from your heart to the rest of your tissues, and veins return blood from the rest of your body to your heart, so the blood can be recirculated. To return blood to your heart, the veins in your legs must work against gravity.\nMuscle contractions in your lower legs act as pumps, and elastic vein walls help blood return to your heart. Tiny valves in your veins open as blood flows toward your heart then close to stop blood from flowing backward. If these valves are weak or damaged, blood can flow backward and pool in the vein, causing the veins to stretch or twist.\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            ", "Diagnosis": "To diagnose varicose veins, your doctor will do a physical exam, including looking at your legs while you're standing to check for swelling. Your doctor may also ask you to describe any pain and aching in your legs.\nYou also may need an ultrasound test to see if the valves in your veins are functioning normally or if there's any evidence of a blood clot. In this noninvasive test, a technician runs a small hand-held device (transducer), about the size of a bar of soap, against your skin over the area of your body being examined.

In this procedure, your doctor injects small- and medium-sized varicose veins with a solution or foam that scars and closes those veins. In a few weeks, treated varicose veins should fade.\n    Although the same vein may need to be injected more than once, sclerotherapy is effective if done correctly. Sclerotherapy doesn't require anesthesia and can be done in your doctor's office.\n    \n    Foam sclerotherapy of large veins. Injection of a large vein with a foam solution is also a possible treatment to close a vein and seal it.\n    Laser treatment. Doctors are using new technology in laser treatments to close off smaller varicose veins and spider veins. Laser treatment works by sending strong bursts of light onto the vein, which makes the vein slowly fade and disappear. No incisions or needles are used.\n    Catheter-assisted procedures using radiofrequency or laser energy. In one of these treatments, your doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) into an enlarged vein and heats the tip of the catheter using either radiofrequency or laser energy. As the catheter is pulled out, the heat destroys the vein by causing it to collapse and seal shut. This procedure is the preferred treatment for larger varicose veins.\n    High ligation and vein stripping. This procedure involves tying off a vein before it joins a deep vein and removing the vein through small incisions. This is an outpatient procedure for most people. Removing the vein won't keep blood from circulating in your leg because veins deeper in the leg take care of the larger volumes of blood.\n    Ambulatory phlebectomy (fluh-BEK-tuh-me). Your doctor removes smaller varicose veins through a series of tiny skin punctures. Only the parts of your leg that are being pricked are numbed in this outpatient procedure. Scarring is generally minimal.\n    Endoscopic vein surgery. You might need this operation only in an advanced case involving leg ulcers if other techniques fail. Your surgeon uses a thin video camera inserted in your leg to visualize and close varicose veins and then removes the veins through small incisions.

Doctors usually delay surgical treatments until you have the maturity to handle follow-up dilation.\n\nOptions for vaginoplasty surgery include:\n\n\nUsing a skin graft (McIndoe procedure). In the McIndoe procedure, your surgeon uses skin from your buttocks to create a vagina. Your surgeon makes an incision in the area where you'll have your vagina, inserts the skin graft to create the structure and places a mold in the newly formed canal. The mold remains in place for one week.\n\nAfter that, you use a vaginal dilator, similar to a firm tampon, which you remove when you use the bathroom or have sexual intercourse. After about three months, you'll use the dilator only at night. Sexual intercourse with artificial lubrication and occasional dilation helps you maintain a functional vagina.\n\nInserting a medical device (Vecchietti procedure). In the Vecchietti procedure, your surgeon places an olive-shaped device at your vaginal opening. Using a thin, lighted viewing instrument (laparoscope) as a guide, your surgeon connects the olive-shaped device to a separate traction device on your lower abdomen.\n\nYou tighten the traction device every day, gradually pulling the olive-shaped device inward to create a vagina over about a week. After your doctor removes the device, you'll need further manual dilation. Sexual intercourse will likely require artificial lubrication.\n\nUsing a portion of your colon (bowel vaginoplasty). In a bowel vaginoplasty, your surgeon diverts a portion of your colon to an opening in your genital area, creating a new vagina. Your surgeon then reconnects your remaining colon.
